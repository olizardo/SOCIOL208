High betweenness nodes control the flow of information in the network between other nodes.\n\nLet us begin by defining some basic concepts on which betweenness centrality measures are built.\n\n### Pairwise Dependency and Betweenness\n\nWe can define the **pair dependency** $\\delta_{i(k)j}$ of a pair of nodes $\\{i, j\\}$ on another node $k$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\delta_{i(k)j}= \\frac{\\sigma_{i(k)j}}{\\sigma_{ij}}\n$$ {#eq-pair}\n\nWhere the denominator of the fraction ($\\sigma_{ij}$) is a count of the *total* number of shortest paths that start and end with nodes $i$ and $j$ and the numerator of the fraction ($\\sigma_{i(k)j}$) is the subset of those paths that include node $k$ as an **inner node**.^[As @brandes08 [p. 137] notes, when $i = j$, then $\\sigma_{ij} = 1$ and when $k \\in \\{i, j\\}$, then $\\sigma_{i(k)j} = 0$.]\n\nAs @freeman79 notes, because the above equation is a ratio it can range from zero to one  with everything in between. As such the pair dependency of a pair of nodes relative to a third has an intuitive interpretation as a *probability*, namely the probability that if you send something starting from $i$ in order for it to get to $j$ it has to go *through* $k$. This probability is 1.0 if $k$ stands in *every* shortest path between $i$ and $j$ and zero if $k$ does not lie in *any* of the shortest paths linking $i$ and $j$.\n\nThe **betweenness centrality** of a node $k$ is then defined as the *sum of the dependencies* that *every pair* of nodes in the graph has on that node:\n\n$$\nC^{BET}_k = \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{\\sigma_{i(k)j}}{\\sigma_{ij}}\n$$ {#eq-bet1}\n\n<!-- Interestingly, @brandes01 shows that the dependence of a node $i$ on another node $k$ can also be expressed as the ratio of the number of shortest paths between $i$ and $k$ divided by the number of shortest paths between $k$ and other nodes $j$ where $j$ is a neighbor of $k$ multiplied by the dependence of $k$ and $j$ plus one, summed over all of $k$'s neighbors $j$.\n\n$$\n\\delta_{ik}\\sum_j = \\frac{\\sigma_{ik}}{\\sigma_{kj}} (\\delta_{kj} + 1)\n$$ {#eq-brandes}\n\nThe betweenness of a node $k$ and in turn be expressed in terms of the last equation as folows:\n\n$$\nC^{BET}_k = \\sum_i \\delta_{ik}\n$$ {#eq-bet2} -->\n\n\n## Computing Betweenness\n\nLet's see an example of how to calculate betweenness centrality using real data. We first load our trusty *Pulp Fiction* data set from the `networkdata` package, which is an **undirected** graph of character scene co-appearances in the film:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    library(networkdata)\n    library(igraph)\n    library(stringr) #using stringr to change names from all caps to title case\n    g <- movie_559\n    V(g)$name <- str_to_title(V(g)$name)\n    V(g)$name[which(V(g)$name == \"Esmarelda\")] <- \"Esmeralda\" #fixing misspelled name\n    E(g)$weight <- 1 #setting weights to 1.0 (relevant for betweenness calculation)\n    V(g)$name\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Brett\"           \"Buddy\"           \"Butch\"           \"Capt Koons\"     \n [5] \"Ed Sullivan\"     \"English Dave\"    \"Esmeralda\"       \"Fabienne\"       \n [9] \"Fourth Man\"      \"Gawker #2\"       \"Honey Bunny\"     \"Jimmie\"         \n[13] \"Jody\"            \"Jules\"           \"Lance\"           \"Manager\"        \n[17] \"Marsellus\"       \"Marvin\"          \"Maynard\"         \"Mia\"            \n[21] \"Mother\"          \"Patron\"          \"Pedestrian\"      \"Preacher\"       \n[25] \"Pumpkin\"         \"Raquel\"          \"Roger\"           \"Sportscaster #1\"\n[29] \"Sportscaster #2\" \"The Gimp\"        \"The Wolf\"        \"Vincent\"        \n[33] \"Waitress\"        \"Winston\"         \"Woman\"           \"Young Man\"      \n[37] \"Young Woman\"     \"Zed\"            \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nLet's say we wanted to figure out the pair dependency between The pair of nodes \"Young Man\" (at the diner) and \"The Pedestrian\" (who appears when Butch encounters Marsellus on the street) on Vincent (e.g., the proportion of shortest paths between the young man and the pedestrian that include Vincent as an intermediary). \n\nFirst we need to figure out the denominator of @eq-pair (the number of shortest paths between the young man and the pedestrian). We can do this using the `igraph` function `all_shortest_paths`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    ap <- all_shortest_paths(g, from = \"Pedestrian\", to = \"Young Man\")\n    ap$vpaths\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian  Butch       Jules       Honey Bunny Young Man  \n\n[[2]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian  Marsellus   Jules       Honey Bunny Young Man  \n\n[[3]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian  Butch       Vincent     Honey Bunny Young Man  \n\n[[4]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian  Marsellus   Vincent     Honey Bunny Young Man  \n\n[[5]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian Butch      Jules      Pumpkin    Young Man \n\n[[6]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian Marsellus  Jules      Pumpkin    Young Man \n\n[[7]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian Butch      Vincent    Pumpkin    Young Man \n\n[[8]]\n+ 5/38 vertices, named, from 9e7cc7a:\n[1] Pedestrian Marsellus  Vincent    Pumpkin    Young Man \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function has three arguments: The graph (`g`), the `from` node (the starting node in the path count) and the `to` node (the end node in the path count). In an undirected graph you get the same result for a pair of nodes regardless of which you you put on the `from` or `to` slots.  \n\nThe `all_shortest_paths` function stores the results in a list object containing various sub-objects. The actual paths (containing the node ids) are in a list sub-object called `vpaths`, which is itself a list (with named vectors containing the indices of the nodes of each path as elements). The `length` of this list is the number of shortest paths between the young man at the diner and the pedestrian:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    length(ap$vpaths)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that the list is of length eight, indicating that there are eight total shortest paths between the pedestrian and the young man. If we wanted to verify the *length of the shortest path* between these two nodes, we would use the `distances` function with the following arguments:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    distances(g, v = \"Young Man\", to = \"Pedestrian\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          Pedestrian\nYoung Man          4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich provides us with the relevant entry in the geodesic distance matrix, telling us that the young man is four steps away from the pedestrian in the network---meaning that each path will involve five nodes (counting the young man and the pedestrian, with three intermediary nodes).\n\nSo the denominator for equation @eq-pair is the length of `ap$vpaths`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    den <- length(ap$vpaths)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe numerator of @eq-pair is the subset of these paths containing Vincent. We can obtain those using the `sapply` function in `R` applied to the list of shortest paths:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    num <- sapply(ap$vpaths, function(x) {\"Vincent\" %in% names(x)})\n    num <- sum(num)\n    num\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe statement inside the function just checks whether the character string \"Vincent\" is present in the named vector of node labels in each path stored in `vpaths`. The sum of the (one/zero or logical TRUE/FALSE) entries of this vector is the number of times Vincent is in a path linking The Pedestrian and The Young Man. \n\nAnd the pair dependency of the young man and the pedestrian on Vincent is just:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    pd <- num/den\n    round(pd, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich says that Vicent lies on 50% of the paths between the The Young Man and The Pedestrian (four out of eight).\n\nAs noted, Vincent's *betweenness* is just the sum of the dependencies of each pair of nodes in the graph on him. We could compute that (not very efficiently) as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    bet.vincent <- 0\n    v <- which(V(g)$name == \"Vincent\")\n    node.vec <- c(1:vcount(g))[-v]\n    for (i in node.vec) {\n        for (j in node.vec) {\n            if (i < j & are_adjacent(g, i, j) == FALSE) {\n                p <- all_shortest_paths(g, from = i, to = j)$vpaths #all shortest paths from i to j\n                bet.vincent <- bet.vincent + sum(sapply(p, function(x) {v %in% x}))/length(p) #paths that involve Vincent divided by total\n                }\n            }\n        }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe first lines initializes Vincent's betweenness at zero. Then we store the position of Vincent in the node id vector in line 2 using the base `R` function `which`, and then create a vector of node ids in line 3 that excludes Vincent. We then loop through all the remaining node ids (making sure we only deal with starting and end nodes that are not adjacent) in lines 4-11, adding the dependencies of each considered pair on Vincent to his running score in line 8. \n\nThe result is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    bet.vincent\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 301\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich is the same result we would have gotten had we used the `betweenness` function in `igraph` specifying that we want the answer just for the Vincent node:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    betweenness(g, v = \"Vincent\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nVincent \n    301 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can of course use the same `igraph` function to (efficiently, using Brandes's [-@brandes01] algorithm) compute the betweenness centrality of each node in the graph as store it in a vector of length $N$:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    pulp.bet <- betweenness(g)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe should expect a character to have high betweenness in this network to the extent that they appear in scenes with characters who themselves don't appear in any scenes together, thus inter-mediating between different parts of the story. Characters who only appear in one scene with some others (like The Wolf or The Gimp) are likely to be low in betweenness.\n\nUsing the information stored in the `pulp.bet` vector of betweenness centralities for each node, we can create a top ten table of betweenness for the *Pulp Fiction* network.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    library(kableExtra)\n    top.10.bet <- sort(pulp.bet, decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]\n    kbl(round(top.10.bet, 2), format = \"pipe\", align = c(\"l\", \"c\"),\n        col.names = c(\"Character\", \"Betweenness\"),\n        caption = \"Top Five Betweenness Characters in Pulp Fiction Network.\") |> \n    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Top Five Betweenness Characters in Pulp Fiction Network.</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Character </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Betweenness </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Vincent </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 301.00 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Butch </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 248.33 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Jules </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 114.17 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Maynard </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 70.00 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Honey Bunny </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 49.50 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Pumpkin </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 49.50 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Sportscaster #1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 36.00 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mia </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 33.50 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Marsellus </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 26.67 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Brett </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2.67 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the three main characters in the story are also the highest in betweenness, with the already considered Vincent at the top of the list (that makes sense since Vincent intermediates between Butch and the rest of the story as he sadly found out in the [toilet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm9VPN1r4Hk)). Somewhat surprisingly, the main antagonist of the story (the pawn shop owner) is also up there. After that we see a big drop in the bottom five of the top ten. \n",
