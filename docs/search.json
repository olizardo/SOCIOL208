To figure that out, all we need to do is sort the degree set (to generate the graph’s degree sequence) and list the top entries:\n\n   d <- degree(g)\n   d.sort <- sort(d, decreasing = TRUE)\n   d.sort[1:8]\n\n    VINCENT       BUTCH       JULES         MIA   MARSELLUS HONEY BUNNY \n         25          17          16          11          10           8 \n    PUMPKIN       BRETT \n          8           7 \n\n\nLine 1 stores the degrees in an object “d”, line 2 creates a “sorted” version of the same object (from bigger to smaller) and line 3 shows the first eight entries of the sorted degree sequence.\nBecause the degree vector “d” is just a regular old vector we can use native R mathematical operations to figure out things like the sum, maximum, minimum, and average degree of the graph:\n\n   sum(d)\n\n[1] 204\n\n   max(d)\n\n[1] 25\n\n   min(d)\n\n[1] 1\n\n   mean(d)\n\n[1] 5.368421\n\n\nSo the sum of degrees is 204, the maximum degree is 25 (belonging to Vincent), the minimum is one, and the average is about 5.4.\nNote that these numbers recreate some well-known equalities in graph theory:\n\nThe sum of degrees is twice the number of edges (the first theorem of graph theory):\n\n\n   2 * ecount(g)\n\n[1] 204\n\n\n\nThe average degree is just the sum of degrees divided by the number of nodes:\n\n\n   sum(d)/vcount(g)\n\n[1] 5.368421\n\n\n\nThe density is just the average degree divided by the number of nodes minus one, as explained here:\n\n\n   mean(d)/(vcount(g) - 1)\n\n[1] 0.1450925\n\n\nSome people also consider the degree variance of the graph as a measure of inequality of connectivity in the system. It is equal to the average sum of square deviations of each node’s degree from the average:\n\\[\n  \\mathcal{v}(G) = \\frac{\\sum_i (k_i - \\bar{k})^2}{n}\n\\]\n\n   sum((d - mean(d))^2)/vcount(g)\n\n[1] 22.96953\n\n\nThis tells us that there is a lot of inequality in the distribution of degrees in the graph (a graph with all nodes equal degree would have variance zero)."

In this case that’s a vector of length 25 + 1 = 26. The first entry gives us the proportion of nodes with degree zero (isolates), the second the proportion of nodes of degree one, and so on up to the graph’s maximum degree.\nSince there are no isolates in the network, we can ignore the first element of this vector, to get the proportion of nodes of each degree in the Pulp Fiction network. To that, we fist create a two-column data.frame with the degrees in the first column and the proportions in the second:\n\n   degree <- c(1:25)\n   prop <- deg.dist\n   prop <- prop[-1]\n   deg.dist <- data.frame(degree, prop)\n   deg.dist\n\n   degree  prop\n1       1 0.053\n2       2 0.158\n3       3 0.237\n4       4 0.158\n5       5 0.132\n6       6 0.053\n7       7 0.026\n8       8 0.053\n9       9 0.000\n10     10 0.026\n11     11 0.026\n12     12 0.000\n13     13 0.000\n14     14 0.000\n15     15 0.000\n16     16 0.026\n17     17 0.026\n18     18 0.000\n19     19 0.000\n20     20 0.000\n21     21 0.000\n22     22 0.000\n23     23 0.000\n24     24 0.000\n25     25 0.026\n\n\nOf course, a better way to display the degree distribution of a graph is via some kind of data visualization, particularly for large networks where a long table of numbers is just not feasible. To do that, we can call on our good friend ggplot:\n\n   # install.packages(ggplot2)\n   library(ggplot2)\n   p <- ggplot(data = deg.dist, aes(x = degree, y = prop))\n   p <- p + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"red\", color = \"red\")\n   p <- p + theme_minimal()\n   p <- p + labs(x = \"\", y = \"Proportion\", \n                 title = \"Degree Distribution in Pulp Fiction Network\") \n   p <- p + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(d), \n                       linetype = 2, linewidth = 0.5, color = \"blue\")\n   p <- p + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25))\n   p\n\n\n\n\nThe plot clearly shows that the Pulp Fiction network degree distribution is skewed with a small number of characters having a large degree \\(k \\geq 15\\) while most other charactrers in the movie have a small degree \\(k \\leq 5\\) indicating inequality of connectivity in the system."

    "text": "The Degree Correlation\nAnother overall network statistic we may want to know is the degree correlation (Newman 2002). How do we compute it? Imagine taking each edge in the network and creating two degree vectors, one based on the degree of the node in one end and the degre of the node in another. Then the degree assortativity coefficient is just the Pearson product moment correlation between these two vectors.\nLet’s see how this would work for the Pulp Fiction network. First we need to extract an edge list from the graph:\n\n   g.el <- as_edgelist(g) #transforming graph to edgelist\n   head(g.el)\n\n     [,1]    [,2]       \n[1,] \"BRETT\" \"MARSELLUS\"\n[2,] \"BRETT\" \"MARVIN\"   \n[3,] \"BRETT\" \"ROGER\"    \n[4,] \"BRETT\" \"VINCENT\"  \n[5,] \"BUDDY\" \"MIA\"      \n[6,] \"BUDDY\" \"VINCENT\"  \n\n\nWe can see that the as_edgelist function takes the igraph network object as input and returns an \\(E \\times 2\\) matrix, with \\(E = 102\\) being the number of rows. Each column of the matrix records the name of the node on each end of the edge. So the first row of the edge list with entries “BRETT” and “MARSELLUS” tells us that there is an edge linking Brett and Marsellus, and so forth for each row.\nTo compute the correlation between the degrees of each node, all we need to do is attach the corresponding degrees to each name for each of the columns of the edge list, which can be done via data wrangling magic from the dplyr package (part of the tidyverse):\n\n   # install.packages(dplyr)\n   library(dplyr)\n   deg.dat <- data.frame(name1 = names(d), name2 = names(d), d)\n   el.temp <- data.frame(name2 = g.el[, 2]) %>% \n      left_join(deg.dat, by = \"name2\") %>% \n      dplyr::select(c(\"name2\", \"d\")) %>% \n      rename(d2 = d) \n   d.el <- data.frame(name1 = g.el[, 1]) %>% \n      left_join(deg.dat, by = \"name1\") %>% \n      dplyr::select(c(\"name1\", \"d\")) %>% \n      rename(d1 = d) %>% \n      cbind(el.temp)\nhead(d.el)\n\n  name1 d1     name2 d2\n1 BRETT  7 MARSELLUS 10\n2 BRETT  7    MARVIN  6\n3 BRETT  7     ROGER  6\n4 BRETT  7   VINCENT 25\n5 BUDDY  2       MIA 11\n6 BUDDY  2   VINCENT 25\n\n\nLine 3 creates a two-column data frame called “deg.dat” with as many rows as there are nodes in the network. The first two columns contain the names of each node (identically listed with different names) and the third columns contains the corresponding node’s degree.\nLines 4-7 use dplyr functions to create a new object “el.temp” joining the degree information to each of the node names listed in the second position in the original edge list “g.el,” and rename the imported column of degrees “d2.”\nLines 8-12 do the same for the nodes listed in the first position in the original edge list, renames the imported columns of degrees “d1,” and the binds the columns of the “el.temp” object to the new object “d.el.” The resulting object has four columns: Two for the names of the nodes incident to each edge on the edge list (columns 1 and 3), and two other ones corresponding to the degrees of the corresponding nodes (columns 2 and 4).\nWe can see from the output of the first few rows of the “d.el” object that indeed “BRETT” is assigned a degree of 7 in each row of the edge list, “BUDDY” a degree of 2, “MARSELLUS” a degree of 10, “VINCENT” a degree of 25 and so forth.\nNow to compute the degree correlation in the network all we need to do is call the native R function cor on the two columns from “d.el” that containing the degree information:\n\n   cor(d.el$d1, d.el$d2)\n\n[1] -0.2989797\n\n\nThe result \\(r_{deg} = -0.298\\) tells us that there is anti-correlation by degree in the Pulp Function network. That is high-degree characters tend to appear with low degree characters, or conversely, high-degree characters (like Marsellus and Jules) don’t appear together very often.\nOf course, igraph has a native function that does all of this for you, implementing the methods in Newman (2002) (who uses the term “assortativity”):\n\n   assortativity_degree(g)\n\n[1] -0.2896427"

In a network, even nodes that are not adjacent, could be indirectly connected to other nodes via a path of some length. So it is useful to know what the average of this quantity is across all dyads in the network. To do that, we first need to compute the length of the shortest path \\(l\\) for each pair of nodes in the network (also known as the geodesic distance). Adjacent nodes get an automatic score of \\(l = 1\\). In igraph this is done as follows:\n\n   S <- distances(g)\n   S[1:7, 1:7]\n\n             BRETT BUDDY BUTCH CAPT KOONS ED SULLIVAN ENGLISH DAVE ESMARELDA\nBRETT            0     2     1          2           2            2         3\nBUDDY            2     0     2          2           2            2         4\nBUTCH            1     2     0          1           2            1         2\nCAPT KOONS       2     2     1          0           2            2         3\nED SULLIVAN      2     2     2          2           0            2         4\nENGLISH DAVE     2     2     1          2           2            0         3\nESMARELDA        3     4     2          3           4            3         0\n\n\nThe igraph function distances takes the network object as input and returns the desired shortest path matrix. So for instance, Brett is directly connected to Butch (they appear in a scene together) but indirectly connected to Buddy via a path of length two (they both appear in scenes with common neighbors even if they don’t appear together).\nThe maximum distance between two nodes in the graph (the longest shortest path to put it confusingly) is called the graph diameter. We can find this out simply by using the native R function for the maximum on the shortest paths matrix:\n\n   max(S)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThis means that in the Pulp Fiction network the maximum degree of separation between two characters is a path of length 8.\nOnce we have the geodesic distance matrix, it is easy to calculate the average path length of the graph:\n\n   rs.S <- rowSums(S)\n   rm.S <- rs.S/(vcount(g) - 1)\n   mean(rm.S)\n\n[1] 2.769559\n\n\n\nFirst (line 1) we sum all the rows (or columns) of the geodesic distance matrix. This vector (of the same length as the number of nodes) gives us the sum of the geodesic distance of each node to each of the nodes (we will use this to compute closeness centrality later).\nThen (line 2) we divide this vector by the number of nodes minus one (to exclude the focal node) to create a vector of the average distance of each node to each of the other nodes.\nFinally (line 3) we take the average across all nodes of this average distance vector to get the graph’s average shortest path length, which in this case equals L = 2.8.\n\nThis means that, on average, each character in Pulp Fiction is separated by little less than three contacts in the co-appearance network (a fairly small world).\nOf course this can also be done in just one step on igraph:\n\n   mean_distance(g)\n\n[1] 2.769559"

    "text": "Appendix: Loading Network Data from a File\nWhen get network data from an archival source, and it will be in the form of a matrix or an edge list, typically in some kind of comma separated value (csv) format. Here will show how to input that into R to create an igraph network object from an outside file.\nFirst we will write the Pulp Fiction data into an edge list and save it to disk. We already did that earlier with the “g.el” object. So all we have to do is save it to your local folder as a csv file:\n\n   #install.packages(here)\n   library(here)\n   write.csv(d.el[c(\"name1\", \"name2\")], here(\"pulp.csv\"))\n\nThe write.csv function just saves an R object into a .csv file. Here the R object is “g.el” and we asked it to save just the columns which contain the name of each character. This represents the adjacency relations in the network as an edge list. We use the package here to keep track of our working directory. See here (pun intended) for details.\nNow suppose that’s the network we want to work with and it’s saved in our hard drive. To load it, we just type:\n\n   g.el <- read.csv(here(\"pulp.csv\"), \n                    col.names = c(\"name1\", \"name2\"))\n   head(g.el)\n\n  name1     name2\n1 BRETT MARSELLUS\n2 BRETT    MARVIN\n3 BRETT     ROGER\n4 BRETT   VINCENT\n5 BUDDY       MIA\n6 BUDDY   VINCENT\n\n\nWhich gives us the edge list we want now saved into an R object of class data.frame. So all we need is to convert that into an igraph object. To do that we use one of the many graph_from... functions in the igraph package. In this case, we want graph_from_edgelist because our network is stored as an edge list:\n\n   g.el <- as.matrix(g.el)\n   g <- graph_from_edgelist(g.el, directed = FALSE)\n   V(g)\n\n+ 38/38 vertices, named, from 5c03ad0:\n [1] BRETT           MARSELLUS       MARVIN          ROGER          \n [5] VINCENT         BUDDY           MIA             BUTCH          \n [9] CAPT KOONS      ESMARELDA       GAWKER #2       JULES          \n[13] PEDESTRIAN      SPORTSCASTER #1 ENGLISH DAVE    FABIENNE       \n[17] FOURTH MAN      HONEY BUNNY     MANAGER         JIMMIE         \n[21] JODY            PATRON          PUMPKIN         RAQUEL         \n[25] WINSTON         LANCE           MAYNARD         THE GIMP       \n[29] ZED             ED SULLIVAN     MOTHER          WOMAN          \n[33] PREACHER        SPORTSCASTER #2 THE WOLF        WAITRESS       \n[37] YOUNG MAN       YOUNG WOMAN    \n\n   E(g)\n\n+ 102/102 edges from 5c03ad0 (vertex names):\n [1] BRETT      --MARSELLUS       BRETT      --MARVIN         \n [3] BRETT      --ROGER           BRETT      --VINCENT        \n [5] BUDDY      --MIA             VINCENT    --BUDDY          \n [7] BRETT      --BUTCH           BUTCH      --CAPT KOONS     \n [9] BUTCH      --ESMARELDA       BUTCH      --GAWKER #2      \n[11] BUTCH      --JULES           MARSELLUS  --BUTCH          \n[13] BUTCH      --PEDESTRIAN      BUTCH      --SPORTSCASTER #1\n[15] BUTCH      --ENGLISH DAVE    BRETT      --FABIENNE       \n[17] BUTCH      --FABIENNE        JULES      --FABIENNE       \n[19] JULES      --FOURTH MAN      VINCENT    --FOURTH MAN     \n+ ... omitted several edges\n\n\nWhich gives us back the original igraph object we have been working with.

The seminar covers the most common data analytic tasks that people engage in when analyzing “network data.” What is network data? What counts as network data is itself a point of contention—as we will see, for some people all data is network data—but let us say for the sake of this class that network data is data in which the unit of analysis is the relation or the interaction between at least two actors or objects, and the data come typically arranged in this “dyadic” form. At the end of the course, you will be familiar with (and will have acquired some practice) the basic techniques used to analyze social network data."

    "section": "Course Content",
    "text": "Course Content\n\nBasic SNA\nSo, what are the things that people usually do when they have network data? Well, they typically want to figure out basic statistics about the interaction system formed by the set of dyads in the data, where a dyad is any two pairs of actors (whether they are connected or not). This task requires computing basic network quantities like the number of nodes and the number of links between entities as well as more advanced statistics based on representing the network as a graph (like the average path length, number of components, etc., all notions we will cover in the first week of class).\n\n\nCentrality and Prestige\nThen come the various things that almost everyone is interested in computing when using network data to answer social science questions. Primarily, this includes measures and indices of a node’s position in the network (e.g., differentiating between more or less central or more or less prestigious nodes), which we will cover in weeks 2 and 3.\n\n\nClasses and Communities\nAfter taking a break in Week 4, we move to the common case of people wanting to see if the nodes in the network fall into definable clusters or classes, where the criterion for being in the same cluster is based on how they connect to other nodes. Here, we want to find clusters of nodes that are similar to one another by some graph theoretic criterion and partition the graph into clusters based on that criterion.\nWeek 6 is dedicated to the next thing we may want to do, and that is to see if we can uncover clumps of densely connected nodes in the network indicating some natural partition into subgroups or communities, defined as nodes that interact more among themselves than they do among those outside the group, leading to the myriad of group and community detection techniques designed to partition a graph into clusters based on the underlying connectivity structure.\n\n\nTwo-Mode and Ego Networks\nThe next two weeks are dedicated to the analysis of some pretty common “non-standard” types of network data (e.g., data that doesn’t use the dyadic relation between objects of the same type as the analytic unit). The first is ego networks, where we first sample a set of units (egos), and then within each ego, we sample a subset of their contacts (e.g., by asking the people who are their most important friends or figuring out the most frequent interaction partners). These data come closest to the traditional data in social science (a rectangular matrix of cases by variables), so various standard techniques—like regression—apply (with some twists).\nThe second type of non-standard network data comes in a two-mode network form, in which some sets of objects are linked to objects of a different set, but there is no data on the links between objects of the same set. Standard cases by variables data in surveys are two-mode data (people connect to variables), as is any web or archival data collecting memberships or interactions between persons and objects (like attendance at events or people buying books on Amazon). We will see that due to a neat mathematical trick, we can transform two-mode into standard dyadic network data and thus deploy the whole panoply of techniques we learned in weeks 1-6 (which means that we can do SNA on all types of data, not just network data, and therefore all data is network data).\n\n\nProbabilistic Models of Networks\nThe bulk of SNA assumes that the ties exist as recorded in the data. Recently (e.g., over the last two decades or so) developed approaches to social network analysis make the ties the dependent variable and thus see the observed network data as a realization of some stochastic process governing the probability that two objects will be linked and thus one that can be modeled statistically. We analyze the theory and methods behind this approach to thinking of network structure from the bottom up and also cover some models designed to treat networks as composed of “relational events” and thus model how events that link entities in networks evolve."

    "text": "Requirements\nThere are three main requirements in the class. Participation (mainly attendance and contributions made during our seminar meetings), a short weekly data exercise, and a longer data analysis paper due at the end of the quarter.\n\nClass Attendance and Class Discussion (25% of grade)\nAttendance is required not optional. If you need to miss a class meeting please let me know beforehand. It is part of your professional socialization to commit to attending class meetings and to inform me when that’s not possible (if only as a point of courtesy). The informal part of participation will be gauged by your contribution to our class discussion in the form of questions, comments, suggestions, wonderings, problems.\n\n\nWeekly Data Analysis Exercises (25% of grade)\nThese will be short weekly assignments in which I will ask you to take a (small) social network data set of your choice and compute some of the basic statistics or implement some of the techniques that we covered the week before. They will be due on Sunday at the end of each week. What you submit will take the form of a file containing the code and results from your analysis (typically an R Markdown file). These will not be graded, but will just be counted as submitted or not submitted.\n\n\nFinal Data Analysis Paper (50% of grade)\nThe basic goal here is for you to end up with something that could be useful to you at the end of the day. Hopefully a basic data exercise that can be the basis of a longer substantive paper or as a standalone research note.\nThis will be a 2500 to 5000 word (single-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) write-up of a data analysis, including some type of network data and/or some kind of network analytic technique (to be discussed and cleared by me). The data source can be obtained from a public repository of network data, or it could be network data that you already have access to or collected yourself.\nIn the paper, you will describe the data, provide key network metrics, describe the data-analytic approach that you will use, and provide a summary of the key empirical patterns that you found, along with a brief conclusion. The paper should be written in the style of a “research note” focused on key empirical findings (not long theory windup or literature review).\nYou will submit an extended abstract of your final project, outlining your main research idea (e.g., data source and type of analysis) due on Sunday of week 6. This will be a one-page, single-spaced document with 12pt Times New Roman Font and 1in margins."

    "text": "Participation (50% of grade)\n\nWeekly Analytic Memo\nThe formal side of participation will come in the form of you submitting a short memo (500 to 1000 words) where you try to put two or more of the readings for that week in conversation with one another. The first memo will be due starting on week 2.\nMemo specifications:\n\nYou should pick at least one reading from the Tuesday meeting and at least one reading from the Thursday meeting as the focus of your memo.\nIn your memo you should feel free to raise questions or issues the readings brought up for you as well as any questions, problems, or weaknesses you identify in the argument or the analyses.\nYou may also feel free to connect the readings to other work you are familiar with, pointing to key points of commonality and difference. The main point of the memo is for me to see evidence of you thinking thought the material, as well as providing fodder for discussion during our meeting.\nThe memo will be due by 5p the day before our first class meeting of the week (that’s Monday) so that I have a chance to read it and comment on it. You will submit it via the assignments tool on Canvas.\n\n\n\nClass Attendance\nAttendance is required not optional. If you need to miss a class meeting please let me know before hand. It is part of your professional socialization to commit to attending class meetings and to inform me when that’s not possible (if only as a point of courtesy).\n\n\nClass Discussion\nThe informal part of participation will be gauged by your contribution to our class discussion. You can use the thoughts developed in your analytic memo as a take-off point for framing your contribution."

    "text": "Paper (50% of grade)\nThe basic goal here is for you to end up with something that could be useful to you at the end of the day. As such, I’ll give you a set of options here, but if you none of these work, we can talk about something that can be customized for your needs and goals. So by the end of the course you will submit one of the following:\n\nDraft of a research paper.- This will be a 3500 to 9000 word (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a research paper. This paper will contain some kind of data analysis, involving networks broadly defined. It will include an introduction reviewing literature and setting up a research problem or question. It will then move on to a methods section describing your data and analytic approach, and will close with a discussion section summarizing key findings, outlining implications for substantive research and theory, and describing potential future work and extensions. The goal here is to come up with a draft of a paper that could one day be submitted to the various social science and sociology-oriented journal focused on substantive research, whether “generalist” (e.g., American Sociological Review) or “specialist” (e.g., Social Networks).\nDraft of a Conceptual Paper.- This will be a 5000 to 10000 word page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) draft of a research paper. The paper will focus on a set of concepts, theoretical ideas, or overall perspectives for approaching the study of social life that are based, inspired, extend, or incorporate network ideas, network thinking, or network concepts and techniques (broadly defined). The goal here is to come up with a draft of a paper that could one day be submitted to the various social science and sociology-oriented journal focused on “theory.”\nExtended Literature Review Draft.- This will be a 10-15 page (double-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in Margins) draft of a literature review of work done from a social network perspective on a topic of your interest. The paper will cover what has been done in the field so far, what the strengths and limitations of previous is, and will note gaps or opportunities for future work addressing those limitations or extending the literature to new substantive domains, perhaps linking previous work to the some of the stuff we will be reading in class.\nDraft of a Research Proposal.- This will be a 10 page (single-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins, including references) draft of a research proposal for a project incorporating either network thinking, theories, or techniques that you plan to start in the near future. The proposal will include a background section reviewing previous work, noting their strengths and limitations, and pointing to gaps in the literature. It will also include an “approach” section describing your research project, your main research questions, the data gathering procedures you will use, and the data-analytic techniques you plan to implement once your data is collected. It will close with an implication sections describing what the contributions of your project will be and why it is relevant and important.\nData Analysis Exercise.- This will be a 2500 to 5000 word (single-spaced, Times New Roman Font, 12pt, 1in margins) write-up of a data analysis, including some type of network data and/or some kind of network analytic technique (to be discussed and cleared by me). The data source can be obtained from a public repository of network data, or it could be network data that you already have access to or collected yourself. In the paper, you will describe the data, provide key network metrics, describe the data-analytic approach that you will use, and provide a summary of the key empirical patterns that you found, along with a brief conclusion. The paper should be written in the style of a “research note” focused on key empirical findings (not long theory windup or literature review).\n\nWhatever you decide, you will submit an extended abstract of your final project, due on Friday of week 6. This will be a one-page, single-spaced document with 12pt Times New Roman Font and 1in margins."
