In networks, communities are subset of nodes that have more interactions or connectivity within themselves than they do outside of themselves (these are sometimes called \"modules\" outside of sociology). Communities thus exemplify the sociological concept of a **group**. \n\nA network has *community structure* if it contains many such subsets or groups of nodes that interact preferentially among themselves. Not all networks have to have community structure; a network in which all nodes interact with equal propensity doesn't have communities.\n\nSo whether a network has community structure, and whether a given guess as to what these communities are yields actual *communities* (cluster of nodes that interact more among themselves than they do with outsiders) is an empirical question than needs to be answered with data.\n\nBut first, we need to develop a criterion for whether a given partition of the network into mutually exclusive node subsets is actually producing *communities* as we defined them earlier. This criterion should be independent of particular methods and algorithms that claim to find communities, so that way we can compare them with one another and see whether the partitions they recommend yield actual communities.\n\nMark @newman06a, who has done the most influential work in this area, proposed such a criterion and called it the **modularity** of a partition (e.g., the extent to which a partition has identified the \"modules\" or subsets of the network). \n\n## A bag of links\n\nAn intuitive way to understand the modularity is as follows. Imagine we have an idea of what the communities in a network are. This could be given by some special  community partition method, our intuition,  or some exogenous coloring on the nodes (e.g., as given by a node attribute like race, gender, position  in the organization, etc.). The membership of each node in each community is thus stored in a vector, $C_i = k$ if node $i$ belongs to community $k$; this vector is of length $N$ where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. \n\nOur job is to decide whether that community partition is a good one. One way to proceed is to imagine that we take the network in question, and we throw each observed link into a bag. Then our modularity measure should give us an idea of the probability that if we drew a link at random, the nodes at the end of each link belong to same community (or have the same color if the communities are defined by exogenous attributes). If the probability is high, then the network has community structure. If the probability is no better than we would expect given a null model that says there is nothing going on in the network connectivity-wise except random chance, then the modularity should be low (and we decide that the partition we chose actually does not divide the network into meaningful communities). \n\nLet's assume our bag of links is full of directed links and we draw a bunch of them at random. Let's call the node at the starting end of the link $s$ and the node at the destination end of the link $d$. Then we can measure the modularity---let's call it $Q$---of a given partition of the network into $m$ clusters as follows:\n\n$$\nQ = \\sum_{k = 1}^m \\left[P(s \\in k \\land d \\in k) - P(s \\in k) \\times P(d \\in k) \\right]\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $P(s \\in k \\land d \\in k)$ is the probability that a link drawn at random has a source and a destination node that belong to the same community $k$; $P(s \\in k)$ is just the probability of drawing a link that has a starting node in community $k$ (regardless of the membership of the destination node) and $P(d \\in k)$ is the probability of drawing a link that has a destination node that belongs to community $k$ (regardless of the membership fo the source node).\n\nIf you remember your elementary probability theory, you know that the *joint* probability of two events that are assumed to be *independent* of one another is just the product of their individual probabilities. So that means that $P(s \\in k) \\times P(d \\in k)$ is the expected probability of finding that both the source and destination node are in the same community $k$ in a network in which communities don't matter for link formation (because the two probabilities are assumed to be independent).\n\nSo the formula for the modularity subtracts the observed probability of finding links with two nodes in the same community from what we would expect if communities didn't matter. So it measures the extent to which we find within-community links in the network beyond what we would expect by chance. Obviously, the higher this number, the higher the deviation from chance is, and the more community structure there is in the network. \n\nLet's move to a real example. @fig-friends shows two plots of the advice network from the `law_friends` data [@lazega01] from the `networkdata` package. The first shows the nodes colored by status in the firm (partners in tan versus associates in blue) and the other shows the nodes colored by gender (men in tan versus women in blue). It is pretty evident that there is more community partitioning in the network by status than by gender; that is, friendship nominations tend to go from people of a given rank to people of the same rank, which makes sense. So a measure of modularity should be higher when using status as our partition than when using gender.\n\n\n::: {#fig-friends .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Nodes colored by status (Partner/Associate)](community_files/figure-html/fig-friends-1.png){#fig-friends-1 width=1152}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Nodes colored by Gender (Men/Women)](community_files/figure-html/fig-friends-2.png){#fig-friends-2 width=1152}\n:::\n\nLaw Firm Friendship Network\n:::\n\n\nLet's see an example of the modularity computed using our \"bag of links\" framework. Below is a quick function that uses `dplyr` code to take a graph as input and return and **edge list** data frame containing the \"community membership\" of each node by some characteristic given by the second input into the function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   link.bag <- function(x, c) {\n      library(dplyr)\n      g.el <- data.frame(as_edgelist(x))\n      names(g.el) <- c(\"vi\", \"vj\")\n      comm.dat <- data.frame(vi = as.vector(V(x)), \n                             vj = as.vector(V(x)), \n                             c = as.vector(c))\n      el.temp <- data.frame(vj = g.el[, 2]) %>% \n         left_join(comm.dat, by = \"vj\") %>% \n         dplyr::select(c(\"vj\", \"c\")) %>% \n         rename(c2 = c) \n      d.el <- data.frame(vi = g.el[, 1]) %>% \n         left_join(comm.dat, by = \"vi\") %>% \n         dplyr::select(c(\"vi\", \"c\")) %>% \n         rename(c1 = c) %>% \n         cbind(el.temp)\n   return(d.el)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo if we wanted an edge list data frame containing each node's status membership in the `law_advice` network, we would just type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   link.dat <- link.bag(g, V(g)$status)\n   head(link.dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  vi c1 vj c2\n1  1  1  2  1\n2  1  1  4  1\n3  1  1  8  1\n4  1  1 17  1\n5  2  1 16  1\n6  2  1 17  1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote than an edge list is already a \"bag of links\" so we can obtain the three probabilities we need to compute the modularity of a partition directly from the edge list data frame. Here's a function that does this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   mod.Q1 <- function(x, c1 = 2, c2 = 4) {\n      Q <- 0\n      comms <- unique(x[, c1])\n      for (k in comms) {\n         e.same <- x[x[, c1] == k & x[, c2] == k, ]\n         e.sour <- x[x[, c1] == k, ]\n         e.dest <- x[x[, c2] == k, ]\n         e.total <- nrow(x)\n         p.same <- nrow(e.same)/e.total\n         p.sour <- nrow(e.sour)/e.total\n         p.dest <- nrow(e.dest)/e.total\n         Q <- Q + (p.same - (p.sour * p.dest))\n      }\n   return(Q)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis function takes the edge list data frame as input. Optionally, you can specify the two columns containing community membership info for the source and destination node in each link (in this case this happens to be the second and fourth columns). The Function works like this: \n\n- The  probability of a link drawn randomly from the bag is just the number of links where the source and destination links belong to the same community (`e.same`, computed in line 5) divided by the total number of links (which is the number of rows in the edge list data frame), this  ratio is computed in line 9 (`p.same`). \n\n- The overall probability of a link containing a *source* node in community $k$ is computed in line 10 (`p.sour`), and the overall probability of a link containing a *destination* node in community $k$ is computed in line 11 (`p.dest`). \n\n- The actual modularity is computed step by step by summation across levels of the community indicator variable in line 12 which is the sum of the difference between `p.same` and the product of `p.sour` times `p.dest` across all communities $m$ (in this case $m = 2$ as there are only two levels of status). \n\nSo if wanted to check if status was more powerful in structuring the community organization of the `law_friends` network than gender, we would just type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   mod.Q1(link.bag(g, V(g)$status))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.2715221\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   mod.Q1( link.bag(g, V(g)$gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.07495538\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich indeed confirms that status is a more powerful group formation principle than gender in this network. \n\n## Modularity from the Adjancency Matrix\n\nNote that while the \"bag of links\" idea is good for showing the basic probabilistic principle behind the modularity in a network, we can compute directly from the adjacency matrix without going through the edge list data frame construction step. \n\nA function that does this looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   mod.Q2 <- function(x, c) {\n   A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(x))\n   vol <- sum(A)\n   Q <- 0\n   for (k in unique(c)) {\n      A.sub <- A[which(c == k), which(c == k)]\n      vol.k <- sum(A.sub)\n      A.i <- A[which(c == k), ]\n      A.j <- A[, which(c == k)]\n      Q <- Q + ((vol.k/vol) - ((sum(A.i) * sum(A.j))/vol^2))\n      }\n   return(Q)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis function just takes a graph and a vector indicating the community membership of each node and returns the modularity as output. Like before the modularity is the difference in the probability of observing a within-community link between two nodes (given by the ratio of the number of links in the sub-adjacency matrix containing only within community-nodes---obtained in line 7---and the overall number of links in the adjacency matrix, computed in line 3) and the *expected* probability of a link between a source node with community membership $k$ and a destination node with the same community membership. \n\nThis last quantity is given by the product of the sum links in a the sub-adjacency matrix with *row nodes* that belong to community $k$ (the source nodes) and the number of links in the sub adjacency matrix with the *column nodes* belonging to community $k$ (the destination nodes) divided by the *square* of the total number of links observed the network. \n\nIn formulese:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nQ = \\sum_{k=1}^m \\left[\\frac{\\sum_{i \\in k} \\sum_{j \\in k} a_{ij}}{\\sum_i \\sum_j a_{ij}}  - \\frac{(\\sum_{i \\in k} \\sum_j a_{ij})(\\sum_i \\sum_{j \\in k} a_{ij})}{(\\sum_i \\sum_j a_{ij})^2} \\right]\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere $\\sum_i \\sum_ja_{ij}$ is the sum of all the entries in the network adjacency matrix, $\\sum_{i \\in k} \\sum_{j \\in k} a_{ij}$ is the sum of all the entries of the sub-adjacency matrix where *both* the row and column nodes come from community $k$, $\\sum_{i \\in k} \\sum_j a_{ij}$ is the sum of all the entries in the sub-adjacency matrix where only the row nodes come from community $k$, and $\\sum_i \\sum_{j \\in k} a_{ij}$ is the sum of all the entries in the sub-adjacency matrix where only the column nodes come from community $k$.\n\nWe can easily see that this approach gives us the same answer as the bag of links version:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   mod.Q2(g, V(g)$status)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.2715221\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   mod.Q2(g, V(g)$gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.07495538\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf course, you don't even have to use a custom function like the above, because `igraph` has one, called (you guessed it) `modularity`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   modularity(g, V(g)$status)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.2715221\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   modularity(g, V(g)$gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.07495538\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut at least now you know what's going on inside of it!\n\n## The Modularity Matrix\n\nObviously, the modularity wouldn't be a famous method if it was just a way of measuring the goodness of a community partition produced by other methods. It itself can be used to find community partitions by using a method that somehow produces node partition that find the largest values that it can take in a graph.\n\nA useful tool in this quest is the **modularity matrix** $\\mathbf{B}$ [@newman06a], which is defined as a variation on the adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, each cell of the modularity matrix $b_{ij}$ takes the value:\n\n$$\nb_{ij} = a_{ij} - \\frac{k^{out}_ik^{in}_j}{\\sum_i\\sum_j a_{ij}}\n$$\n\nWhere $k^{out}_i$ is node $i$'s outdegree and $k^{in}_j$ is node j's indegree. Note that the modularity matrix has the same \"observed minus expected\" structure as the formulas for the modularity.

The resulting \"status\" vector has both negative and positive entries.

But now we have also used a pure link-based approach to finding communities. How do they compare? Here's a way to find out:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   library(kableExtra)\n   t <- table(V(ug)$status, le.res$membership)\n   kbl(t, row.names = TRUE, align = \"c\", format = \"html\") %>%\n      column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>% \n      kable_styling(full_width = TRUE,\n                     bootstrap_options = c(\"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> 1 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> 2 </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3 </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 27 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 9 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 22 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is just a **contingency table** listing status in the rows (1 = partner) and the three leading eigenvector communities in the columns. \n\nWe find that community one (the most coherent; in orange) is composed of 89% of partners. So it is a high status clique. Community three (in blue) on the other hand is composed of 100% of associates, a less dense, but completely (low) status homogeneous clique. Finally community two (green) is a status-mixed clique, composed of nine partners and seven associates. \n\nSo in this network, both status and endogenous group dynamics seem to be at play.\n\n## An Agglomerative Approach Based on the Modularity\n\nThe leading eigenvector approach discussed above is a **divisive** clustering algorithm. All nodes begin in one community, then we split in two, then we try to split one of those two into two other ones (if the modularity increases) and so forth.\n\nBut as we noted in the previous handout, another way to cluster is *bottom up*. All nodes begin in their own singleton cluster, and we join nodes if they maximize some criterion, in this case,  the modularity. We then join new nodes to that group if they increase the modularity, otherwise we try other joins, merging communities as we go along, until we can't increase the modularity any longer.\n\nThis **agglomerative** approach to clustering is not guaranteed to reach some kind of global maximum, but it can work in most applied settings even at the risk of getting stuck in a local optimum. \n\n@newman04 developed an agglomerative algorithm that optimizes the modularity, a more recent version of which is included in an `igraph` function called `cluster_fast_greedy` [@clauset_etal04]. \n\nLet's try it out to see how it works:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   fg.res <- cluster_fast_greedy(ug)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting list object has various sub-objects as components. One of them is called `merges` which gives a history of the various merges that resulted in the final communities. This means that we can view the results as a **dendrogram** just like we did with structural similarity analyses based on hierarchical clustering of  a distance matrix. \n\nTo do this we just transform the resulting object into an `hclust` object and plot:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   hc <- as.hclust(fg.res)\n   par(cex = 0.5) #smaller labels\n   plot(hc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](community_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich gives us the sense that the network is divided into three communities like we saw earlier. If wanted to see which nodes are in which, we could just cut the dendrogram at $k = 3$:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   library(dendextend)\n   cutree(hc, k = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 \n 1  1  2  1  2  2  2  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  1  1  1  2  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  1 \n27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 \n 1  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  2  2  1  3  1  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  2  2  3  1  3  3 \n53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 \n 3  3  3  2  3  3  3  2  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich provides the relevant assignment to communities (if we wanted more communities, we would cut the tree at a lower height).\n\nOf course, this information was already stored in our results in the `membership` object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   names(fg.res$membership) <- 1:68\n   fg.res$membership\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 \n 1  1  2  1  2  2  2  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  1  1  1  2  1  1  1  1  1  1  2  1 \n27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 \n 1  2  1  2  2  2  2  1  2  2  1  3  1  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  2  2  3  1  3  3 \n53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 \n 3  3  3  2  3  3  3  2  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-oth-1 visualizes the resulting three-community partition, which is pretty close to what we got using the leading eigenvector method. \n\n## Community Detection Using Edge Betweenness\n\nA final approach to community detection with good sociological bona fides relies on **edge betweenness**, a concept we covered on the centrality handout. And edge has high betweenness if many other pairs of nodes need to use to reach one another via shortest paths. \n\nIt follows that if we iteratively identify high betweenness edges, removing the top one, recalculate the edge betweenness on the resulting edge-deleted subgraph, and remove *that* top one (or flip a coin if two are tied) we have an algorithm for identifying communities as those subgraphs that end up being disconnected after removing the bridges [@girvan_newman02]. \n\nNote that like the leading eigenvector method, this approach is **divisive** with all nodes starting in a single cluster, then that cluster splitting in two, and so forth. This algorithm is implemented in `igraph` in the function `cluster_edge_betweenness`. \n\nLet's see how it works:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   eb.res <- cluster_edge_betweenness(ug, directed = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nInterestingly, even though this is a divisive algorithm, the results can be presented as a dendrogram, but storing top down divisions rather than bottom up merges:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   hc <- as.hclust(eb.res)\n   par(cex = 0.5) #smaller labels\n   plot(hc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](community_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the edge betweenness provides a different picture of the community structure of the network. This is not surprising because it is based on graph theoretic principles and not on null model principles like the modularity: The picture here is of two broad communities (in the middle) surrounded by many smaller islands, including some singletons. \n\nWe can, of course, combine the modularity and edge-betweenness criteria by trying out dendrogram cuts until we find one with the highest modularity. \n\nA simple function that does that looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   top.mod <- function(x, g, m) {\n      k <- 1:m\n      Q <- rep(0, m)\n      tab <- cbind(k, Q)\n      for (i in 2:m) {\n         c <- cutree(x, i)\n         tab[i, 2] <- round(modularity(g, c, directed = FALSE), 3)\n      }\n   return(tab)\n   }\n   top.mod(hc, ug, 25)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       k     Q\n [1,]  1 0.000\n [2,]  2 0.000\n [3,]  3 0.067\n [4,]  4 0.069\n [5,]  5 0.073\n [6,]  6 0.073\n [7,]  7 0.072\n [8,]  8 0.071\n [9,]  9 0.070\n[10,] 10 0.167\n[11,] 11 0.166\n[12,] 12 0.181\n[13,] 13 0.178\n[14,] 14 0.183\n[15,] 15 0.179\n[16,] 16 0.183\n[17,] 17 0.182\n[18,] 18 0.188\n[19,] 19 0.193\n[20,] 20 0.194\n[21,] 21 0.192\n[22,] 22 0.188\n[23,] 23 0.208\n[24,] 24 0.201\n[25,] 25 0.195\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich seems to recommend we divide the graph into 23 communities! This is, of course, what is stored in the `membership` object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   names(eb.res$membership) <- 1:68\n   eb.res$membership\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 \n 1  1  2  1  3  4  2  1  1  1  1  1  1  5  6  1  1  3  7  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 \n27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 \n 1  3  1  8  1  3  3  1  3  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  9  7 10 11  3  3 12 13 14 15 \n53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 \n16 17  3 18  7 19 20 21 22  1 23 23 23 23 23 23 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother thing we can do with the `edge_betweenness` function output is that we can highlight the edges identified as **bridges** during the divisive process, as this information is stored in the object `bridges`.
