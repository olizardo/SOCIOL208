Here we extend the discussion to the other two of the big three, **closeness** and **betwennness**. As always, we load up the usual *Southern Women* (SW) data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n    library(igraph)\n    library(networkdata)\n    g <- southern_women\n    A <- as_biadjacency_matrix(g)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Geodesic Distances\n\nGeodesic distances work a bit different in two-mode networks because of the only between-node-sets edges restriction. \n\nFor instance, the minimum geodesic distance $g_{ii'}$ between two people is two (a person cannot be adjacent to another person), but it is one between a person and a group (if the person is a member of the group). \n\nIn the same way, a group $g$ cannot be at geodesic distance less than three from a person $p*$ who is not a member, because the shortest path is $g-p-g^*-p^*$. \n\nThat is, there has to be some other group $g^*$ shared between a member $p$ of the focal group $g$ and another person $p^*$ for the shortest path between $g$ and the non-member $p^*$ to exist, and that involves three links at minimum: $g-p$, $p-g^*$, and $g^*-p^*$. This means that the links in paths in two-mode networks always alternate between persons and group nodes.\n\nBeyond that geodesic distances work the same way. In `igraph` when we use the `distances` function on a bipartite graph, we get:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   D.pg <- distances(g)\n   head(D.pg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          EVELYN LAURA THERESA BRENDA CHARLOTTE FRANCES ELEANOR PEARL RUTH\nEVELYN         0     2       2      2         2       2       2     2    2\nLAURA          2     0       2      2         2       2       2     2    2\nTHERESA        2     2       0      2         2       2       2     2    2\nBRENDA         2     2       2      0         2       2       2     2    2\nCHARLOTTE      2     2       2      2         0       2       2     4    2\nFRANCES        2     2       2      2         2       0       2     2    2\n          VERNE MYRNA KATHERINE SYLVIA NORA HELEN DOROTHY OLIVIA FLORA 6/27 3/2\nEVELYN        2     2         2      2    2     2       2      2     2    1   1\nLAURA         2     2         2      2    2     2       2      4     4    1   1\nTHERESA       2     2         2      2    2     2       2      2     2    3   1\nBRENDA        2     2         2      2    2     2       2      4     4    1   3\nCHARLOTTE     2     4         4      2    2     2       4      4     4    3   3\nFRANCES       2     2         2      2    2     2       2      4     4    3   3\n          4/12 9/26 2/25 5/19 3/15 9/16 4/8 6/10 2/23 4/7 11/21 8/3\nEVELYN       1    1    1    1    3    1   1    3    3   3     3   3\nLAURA        1    3    1    1    1    1   3    3    3   3     3   3\nTHERESA      1    1    1    1    1    1   1    3    3   3     3   3\nBRENDA       1    1    1    1    1    1   3    3    3   3     3   3\nCHARLOTTE    1    1    1    3    1    3   3    3    3   3     3   3\nFRANCES      1    3    1    1    3    1   3    3    3   3     3   3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   tail(D.pg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      EVELYN LAURA THERESA BRENDA CHARLOTTE FRANCES ELEANOR PEARL RUTH VERNE\n4/8        1     3       1      3         3       3       3     1    1     1\n6/10       3     3       3      3         3       3       3     3    3     3\n2/23       3     3       3      3         3       3       3     3    3     3\n4/7        3     3       3      3         3       3       3     3    3     1\n11/21      3     3       3      3         3       3       3     3    3     3\n8/3        3     3       3      3         3       3       3     3    3     3\n      MYRNA KATHERINE SYLVIA NORA HELEN DOROTHY OLIVIA FLORA 6/27 3/2 4/12 9/26\n4/8       1         1      1    1     3       1      1     1    2   2    2    2\n6/10      1         1      1    1     1       3      3     3    4   4    4    4\n2/23      3         3      3    1     1       3      1     1    4   4    4    4\n4/7       1         1      1    1     1       3      3     3    4   4    4    4\n11/21     3         1      1    1     3       3      3     3    4   4    4    4\n8/3       3         1      1    1     3       3      3     3    4   4    4    4\n      2/25 5/19 3/15 9/16 4/8 6/10 2/23 4/7 11/21 8/3\n4/8      2    2    2    2   0    2    2   2     2   2\n6/10     4    2    2    2   2    0    2   2     2   2\n2/23     4    2    2    2   2    2    0   2     2   2\n4/7      4    2    2    2   2    2    2   0     2   2\n11/21    4    2    2    2   2    2    2   2     0   2\n8/3      4    2    2    2   2    2    2   2     2   0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich is a square matrix of dimensions $(M + N) \\times (M + N)$; that's $(18 + 14) \\times (18 + 14) = 32 \\times 32$ in our case. \n\nWe can check in `R`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   dim(D.pg)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 32 32\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see in the distance matrix, distances between nodes in the same set are even $g_{ii'|jj'} = \\{2, 4, \\ldots\\}$ but distances in nodes in different sets are odd $g_{ij|ji} = \\{1, 3, \\ldots\\}$.
