This is called ego's **clustering coefficient**.  \n\nLet's see how it works. First we load up the *New Hope* Star Wars social network included in the `networkdata` package [@gabasova16]:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   library(networkdata)\n   g <- starwars[[4]]\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `starwars` object contain a `list` of igraph network data sets corresponding to seven of the Star Wars films (the three originals, three prequels, and *The Force Awakens*). They are ordered in terms of the film chronology, so Episode IV, *A New Hope* is the fourth element in the list. \n\nAs we said an ego graph is just a subgraph centered on a particular actor. So R2-D2's ego graph is just:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   library(igraph)\n   N <- neighbors(g, \"R2-D2\")\n   r2 <- subgraph(g, c(\"R2-D2\", names(N))) #ego graph\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd we can just plot it like we would any `igraph` object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   V(r2)$color <- rep(2, vcount(r2)) #alters appear in blue\n   V(r2)$color[which(V(r2)$name == \"R2-D2\")] <- 1 #ego appears in tan  \n   plot(r2, \n     vertex.size=10, vertex.frame.color=\"lightgray\", \n     vertex.label.dist=2, \n     layout = layout_as_star(r2, center = \"R2-D2\"),\n     vertex.label.cex = 1.25, edge.color = \"lightgray\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R2-D2's Ego Network.](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that we use the `layout_as_star()` for the layout, so that the ego is put in the center of the star graph surrounded by their alters, we can specify who the star node is using the option `center`.\n\nR2-D2's clustering coefficient is just the density of the graph that includes only the alters:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   alters <- r2 - vertex(\"R2-D2\")\n   C <- round(edge_density(alters), 2)\n   C\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.67\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe clustering coefficient $C_i$ for an ego $i$ ranges from zero to one. $C = 0$ means that *none* of ego's alters are connected to one another and $C = 1$ means that *all* of ego's alters are connected to one another. In this case, $C = 0.67$ means that 67% of R2-D2's alters are connected (e.g., co-appear in scenes) to one another. \n\nTypically we would want to compute the clustering coefficient of every node in a graph. This can be done using our trusty `lapply` and `sapply` meta-functions. \n\nWe proceed in three steps:\n\nFirst, we turn the code we used to find R2-D2's ego graph into a function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   create.ego <- function(x, w) {\n      alter.net <- subgraph(w, neighbors(w, x))\n      return(alter.net)\n      }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we `lapply` the function to each node in the network:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   ego.graphs <- lapply(V(g)$name, create.ego, w = g)\n   head(ego.graphs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\nIGRAPH 810ef73 UNW- 9 24 -- Episode IV – A New Hope\n+ attr: name (g/c), name (v/c), height (v/n), mass (v/n), hair_color\n| (v/c), skin_color (v/c), eye_color (v/c),

Obi-Wan, Leia, Chewbacca, Han Solo and Droid communities on the right. Note that we didn't have to use that `layout_as_star` option because when ego's network has community structure, the traditional spring embedding layout will put ego at the center.\n\nNote that in the ego graph that includes ego, each connected alter is a **triangle** in the ego graph.

The reason for this is that if the alter-to-alter network for an ego is a **complete graph**, then the average degree of that graph will necessarily be equal to the number of nodes in the alter-to-alter graph (ego's degree) minus one. \n\nGenerally, $ES$ will be smaller than ego's degree, except in the case where ego is at the center of a star graph with $C_i = 0$ (none of their contacts are connected to one another), in which case $ES$ will be equal to ego's degree (the effective size will be equal to the actual size).\n\nNote that if two nodes have the same degree, but different clustering coefficients, then the effective size of their networks will be different, with the node with the *larger* clustering coefficient having a *smaller* effective size.\n\nHere's an example from *A New Hope*:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![k = 7, C = 0.76, ES = 2.4](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![k = 7, C = 0.57, ES = 3.6](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-2.png){width=768}\n:::\n\nTwo Ego Networks of the Same Size but Different Effective Size\n:::\n\n\nHere we can see that even though both Obi-Wan and Red Leader have an ego network of the same size ($k = 7$), a larger proportion of Obi-Wan's contacts ($C = 0.76$) are connected to one another that Red Leader's ($C = 0.57$), which means that Obi-Wan's effective size ($ES = 2.4$) ends up being smaller than Red Leader's ($ES = 3.6$). \n\n### Ego-Network Betweenness\n\nAn alternative structural measure of ego's position in the ego network, also closely related to the clustering coefficient, is **ego network betweenness**. \nAs @everett_borgatti05 note, in an ego network betweenness is determined by the number of paths of length two that involve ego, that is, by the number of disconnected alters. \n\nTherefore, if $\\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix recording the links between the alters, then $\\mathbf{A}^2$ will contain the number of paths of length two between each pair of alters. Because we are only interested in the number of paths of length two between each pair of *disconnected* alters, we multiply (element-wise) this matrix by the adjacency matrix corresponding to the **graph complement** (a matrix with a one for every zero in the original adjacency matrix and a zero for each one). We then take the sum of the reciprocals of one of the triangles (excluding the main diagonal) of the resulting matrix to find the betweenness of ego. \n\nIn math:\n\n$$\nC_B(Ego) = \\sum_{i < j}\\left[\\mathbf{A}^2 \ (\\mathbf{J} - \\mathbf{A})\\right]_{ij}^{-1}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is a matrix full of ones of the same dimensions as $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\$ indicates element-wise matrix multiplication.\n\nA simple function that does this looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   ego.bet <- function(x, n) {\n      N <- neighbors(x, n)\n      alter.net <- subgraph(x, c(n, names(N)))\n      A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(alter.net))\n      A2 <- A %*% A\n      J <- matrix(1, nrow(A), ncol(A))\n      cb <- A2 * (J - A)\n      cb <- 1/cb\n      cb[is.infinite(cb)] <- 0\n      cb <- sum(cb[upper.tri(cb)])\n      return(cb)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's see how it works for Luke:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(ego.bet(g, \"LUKE\"), 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 45.92\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich says that Luke has pretty high ego-network betweenness.\n\nWe can, of course, compute it for everyone in the network like before:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(sapply(V(g)$name, ego.bet, x = g), 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      R2-D2   CHEWBACCA       C-3PO        LUKE DARTH VADER       CAMIE \n       3.33        0.00        5.42       45.92        1.00        0.00 \n      BIGGS        LEIA        BERU        OWEN     OBI-WAN       MOTTI \n       5.58       25.83        0.25        0.00        2.50        0.00 \n     TARKIN         HAN     DODONNA GOLD LEADER       WEDGE  RED LEADER \n       0.00        0.00        0.00        0.67        0.67        3.83 \n    RED TEN \n       0.00 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich confirms our original impression of Luke as the highest ego-network betweenness character with Leia in second place.\n\nWhat does it mean to have an ego-network betweenness of zero?

For a categorical attribute with $m$ levels, this is given by:\n\n$$\nH = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^m p_k^2\n$$\n\nWhere $p_k$ is the proportion of ego's alters that fall under category level $k$. \n\nThe $H$ measure ranges from a minimum of $H = 0$ (all of ego's alters belong to a single category) to a maximum of $H = 1- \\frac{1}{m}$ (all of ego's alters belong to a different category).\n\nWhen the Blau diversity index is normalized by its theoretical maximum, it is sometimes referred to as the **Index of Qualitative Variation** or $IQV$:\n\n$$\nIQV = \\frac{1 - \\sum_{k=1}^m p_k^2}{1-\\frac{1}{m}}\n$$\n\nThe main difference between $H$ and $IQV$ is that the latter has a maximum of $IQV = 1.0$ indicating the top diversity that can be observed for a categorical attribute with $m$ categories. \n\nLet's see how this would work. \n\nFirst, let's switch to the *Attack of the Clones* Star Wars graph:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   g <- starwars[[2]]\n   g <- subgraph(g, degree(g)> 1) #removing singletons\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, we will pick the vertex attribute `homeworld` and try to measure how diverse is each character's ego network on this score. \n\nTo do that, we need to get the proportion of characters from each homeworld in the network. \n\nLet's check out this vertex attribute:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   V(g)$homeworld\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Naboo\"          \"Naboo\"          \"Naboo\"          NA              \n [5] NA               \"Haruun Kal\"     NA               \"Cerea\"         \n [9] \"Alderaan\"       \"Naboo\"          \"Stewjon\"        \"Tatooine\"      \n[13] \"Naboo\"          NA               NA               NA              \n[17] \"Kamino\"         \"Kamino\"         \"Kamino\"         \"Concord Dawn\"  \n[21] \"Tatooine\"       \"Tatooine\"       \"Tatooine\"       \"Tatooine\"      \n[25] \"Serenno\"        NA               \"Geonosis\"       \"Cato Neimoidia\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are some `NA` values here, so let's create a residual category called \"other\":\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   V(g)$homeworld[is.na(V(g)$homeworld)] <- \"Other\"\n   V(g)$homeworld\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"Naboo\"          \"Naboo\"          \"Naboo\"          \"Other\"         \n [5] \"Other\"          \"Haruun Kal\"     \"Other\"          \"Cerea\"         \n [9] \"Alderaan\"       \"Naboo\"          \"Stewjon\"        \"Tatooine\"      \n[13] \"Naboo\"          \"Other\"          \"Other\"          \"Other\"         \n[17] \"Kamino\"         \"Kamino\"         \"Kamino\"         \"Concord Dawn\"  \n[21] \"Tatooine\"       \"Tatooine\"       \"Tatooine\"       \"Tatooine\"      \n[25] \"Serenno\"        \"Other\"          \"Geonosis\"       \"Cato Neimoidia\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat!

It returns the Blau diversity index score for that ego on that attribute by default; when `norm` is set to `TRUE` it returns the normalized Blau score (a.k.a. the $IQV$). \n\nLet's see Padme's Home World ego network diversity score:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(blau(\"PADME\", g, \"homeworld\"), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.796\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich says that Padme has a fairly diverse ego network when it comes to Home World. \n\nWe can, of course, just use `sapply` to compute everyone's Home World ego network diversity score:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(sapply(V(g)$name, blau, w = g, a = \"homeworld\"), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          R2-D2   CAPTAIN TYPHO         EMPEROR SENATOR ASK AAK    ORN FREE TAA \n          0.444           0.667           0.815           0.776           0.444 \n     MACE WINDU            YODA    KI-ADI-MUNDI     BAIL ORGANA         JAR JAR \n          0.820           0.840           0.750           0.776           0.780 \n        OBI-WAN          ANAKIN           PADME            SOLA           JOBAL \n          0.858           0.809           0.796           0.625           0.625 \n          RUWEE         TAUN WE         LAMA SU       BOBA FETT      JANGO FETT \n          0.625           0.625           0.500           0.667           0.625 \n          C-3PO            OWEN            BERU          CLIEGG     COUNT DOOKU \n          0.444           0.320           0.320           0.320           0.860 \n        SUN RIT          POGGLE     NUTE GUNRAY \n          0.833           0.833           0.833 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this network Count Dooku stands out as having a very diverse ego network by Home World, while Owen sports a very homogeneous ego network on the same attribute. \n\nLet's see a side-by-side comparison:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-2.png){width=768}\n:::\n\nTwo Ego Networks with Nodes Colored by Homeworld\n:::\n\n\nAnd here are the corresponding $IQV$ scores for everyone in the network:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(sapply(V(g)$name, blau, w = g, \n                a = \"homeworld\", norm = TRUE), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          R2-D2   CAPTAIN TYPHO         EMPEROR SENATOR ASK AAK    ORN FREE TAA \n          0.889           1.000           0.951           0.969           0.889 \n     MACE WINDU            YODA    KI-ADI-MUNDI     BAIL ORGANA         JAR JAR \n          0.957           0.960           1.000           0.969           0.936 \n        OBI-WAN          ANAKIN           PADME            SOLA           JOBAL \n          0.953           0.924           0.910           0.937           0.937 \n          RUWEE         TAUN WE         LAMA SU       BOBA FETT      JANGO FETT \n          0.937           0.937           1.000           1.000           0.937 \n          C-3PO            OWEN            BERU          CLIEGG     COUNT DOOKU \n          0.889           0.640           0.640           0.640           0.983 \n        SUN RIT          POGGLE     NUTE GUNRAY \n          1.000           1.000           1.000 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we noted an ego network with maximum diversity $IQV = 1.0$ is one where every alter is in a different category.

We may also want to get a sense of how *homophilous* an ego network is, namely, the extent to which ego connects to alters that are the same or different from *them*.\n\nFor instance, a person can have an ego network composed of 100% alters who are different from them on a given attribute (maximum \"heterophily\") but those alters could be 100% homogeneous---e.g., all come from the same planet---and thus ego will have the *minimum* Blau diversity score ($H = 0$).  \n\nTo measure homophily in the ego network we use the **EI homophily index**. This is given by:\n\n$$\nEI = \\frac{E-I}{E+I}\n$$\n\nWhere $E$ is the number of \"external\" ties (alter different from ego on attribute), and $I$ is the number of \"internal\" ties (alter same as ego on attribute).\n\nThe $EI$ index ranges from a minimum of $EI = -1$, indicating maximum homophily, to a maximum of $EI = 1$, indicating maximum heterophily. An EI index value of zero indicates no preference for internal over external ties. \n\nSo let's write a function that does what we want to calculate EI:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   EI <- function(n, w, a) {\n      x <- subgraph(w, neighbors(w, n))\n      E <- sum(vertex_attr(w, a, n) != vertex_attr(x, a)) #n. external ties\n      I <- sum(vertex_attr(w, a, n) == vertex_attr(x, a))  #n. internal ties\n      res = (E - I)/(E + I) #EI Index\n      return(res)\n      }\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's look at the attribute `sex`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   V(g)$sex\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"none\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   NA       NA       \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"  \n [9] \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   \"female\" NA       NA       NA      \n[17] \"female\" \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   \"none\"   \"male\"   \"female\" \"male\"  \n[25] \"male\"   NA       \"male\"   \"male\"  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGetting rid of the `NA` values:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   V(g)$sex[is.na(V(g)$sex)] <- \"Other\"\n   V(g)$sex\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"none\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   \"Other\"  \"Other\"  \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"  \n [9] \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   \"female\" \"Other\"  \"Other\"  \"Other\" \n[17] \"female\" \"male\"   \"male\"   \"male\"   \"none\"   \"male\"   \"female\" \"male\"  \n[25] \"male\"   \"Other\"  \"male\"   \"male\"  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd calculating the homophily index on gender for everyone:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   EI <- sapply(V(g)$name, EI, w = g, a = \"sex\")\n   round(EI, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          R2-D2   CAPTAIN TYPHO         EMPEROR SENATOR ASK AAK    ORN FREE TAA \n           0.33           -1.00           -0.56            0.71            0.33 \n     MACE WINDU            YODA    KI-ADI-MUNDI     BAIL ORGANA         JAR JAR \n          -0.60           -0.60           -1.00           -0.71           -0.40 \n        OBI-WAN          ANAKIN           PADME            SOLA           JOBAL \n          -0.53           -0.11            0.88            0.00            0.00 \n          RUWEE         TAUN WE         LAMA SU       BOBA FETT      JANGO FETT \n           0.00            1.00            0.00           -0.33           -0.50 \n          C-3PO            OWEN            BERU          CLIEGG     COUNT DOOKU \n           0.67            0.20            0.60            0.20           -0.60 \n        SUN RIT          POGGLE     NUTE GUNRAY \n           1.00           -0.33           -0.33 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see, the Emperor, Mace Windu, Obi-Wan and other such characters have a homophilous \"bro\" network.

As you can see, the $NEI$ weights both the number of external and $E$ the number of internal ties $I$ by their maximum possible values in the network. \n\nHere's a function that does that:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   NEI <- function(n, w, a) {\n      N <- vcount(w) \n      Ns <- sum(vertex_attr(w, a) == vertex_attr(w, a, n))\n      x <- subgraph(w, neighbors(w, n))\n      E <- sum(vertex_attr(w, a, n) != vertex_attr(x, a)) \n      I <- sum(vertex_attr(w, a, n) == vertex_attr(x, a)) \n      E <- E/(N - Ns) #normalized E\n      I <- I/Ns #normalized I\n      res = (E - I)/(E + I)\n      return(res)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's re-check Mace Windu's and Padme's EI index using the normalized version:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(NEI(\"MACE WINDU\", g, \"sex\"), 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.44\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(NEI(\"PADME\", g, \"sex\"), 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.32\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see the NEI scores are less extreme than the unnormalized ones, once we take into account that the majority of characters in the film are men.\n\nHere are the NEI scores with respect to gender for everyone:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   NEI <- sapply(V(g)$name, NEI, w = g, a = \"sex\")\n   round(NEI, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          R2-D2   CAPTAIN TYPHO         EMPEROR SENATOR ASK AAK    ORN FREE TAA \n          -0.73           -1.00           -0.39            0.24           -0.29 \n     MACE WINDU            YODA    KI-ADI-MUNDI     BAIL ORGANA         JAR JAR \n          -0.44           -0.44           -1.00           -0.59           -0.20 \n        OBI-WAN          ANAKIN           PADME            SOLA           JOBAL \n          -0.36            0.11            0.32           -0.57           -0.57 \n          RUWEE         TAUN WE         LAMA SU       BOBA FETT      JANGO FETT \n          -0.57            1.00            0.21           -0.13           -0.32 \n          C-3PO            OWEN            BERU          CLIEGG     COUNT DOOKU \n          -0.44            0.40           -0.35            0.40           -0.44 \n        SUN RIT          POGGLE     NUTE GUNRAY \n           1.00           -0.13           -0.13 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInterestingly, while most people's scores are attenuated towards zero in the normalized scale, R2-D2's becomes more extreme going from weakly positive (demonstrating \"gender\" heterophily) to extreme negative (showing same \"gender\" preference). \n\nLet's see what's going on:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![R2-D2's Ego Network with Nodes Colored by Gender](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we can see that the reason why R2-D2 ends up being high in homophily in the NEI despite containing a network with just three nodes and only a single \"same-gender\" (i.e., none) tie, is that he is connected to C3PO who is the only other character (a droid) whose gender is also assigned to \"none.\"\n\nAnd here's the graph's overall NEI:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   NEI.gender = mean(NEI)\n   round(NEI.gender, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -0.19\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich shows that our previous unnormalized average under-estimated homophily in this network. Instead, there is a moderately strong tendency for characters to co-appear with others of the same gender classification once the imbalance favoring men is accounted for. \n\n### Other Ways of Accounting for Imbalanced Group Sizes in Homophily Metrics\n\nAs may already be evident, when constructing a homophily measure that takes into account the population (or local network) proportions of various types of alters, there are four pieces of information that we have to take into account:\n\na) Number of alters linked to ego of the same category as ego.\nb) Number of alters linked to ego of a different category from ego.\nc) Number of alters not linked to ego of the same category as ego.\nd) Number of alters not linked to ego of a different category from ego.\n\nWhich yields a classic 2 by 2 table. \n\nHere's a function that produces such a table for each ego for a given attribute:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   abcd <- function(n, w, a) {\n      x <- subgraph(w, neighbors(w, n))\n      same <- vertex_attr(w, a, n) == vertex_attr(w, a)\n      same <- same[!(same %in% n)] #deleting ego node from vector\n      tied <- as.vector(V(w)$name) %in% names(neighbors(w, n))\n      tab <- table(tied, same)\n      tab <- tab[2:1, 2:1] #reversing row and column order of table\n      return(tab)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo for Count Dooku with respect to gender, this 2 X 2 table looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   abcd(\"COUNT DOOKU\", g, \"sex\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE     8     2\n  FALSE    9     9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo here we can see that Dooku is linked to eight others of the same gender, but there are nine other men he's not linked to. In the same way, he has two different-gender ties, but there are nine others of a different gender he's not tied to. \n\nAs @everett_borgatti12 note, we can label the cells of the 2 X 2 EI table with the letters from the above list to highlight each piece of information in each cell: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE  a    b    \n  FALSE c    d    \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing this nomenclature, the EI index is given by:\n\n$$\nEI = \\frac{a-b}{a+b}\n$$\n\nIt is clear that the EI only uses information only from the first row (alters tied to ego) and is thus sensitive to group size imbalances because it ignores the other pieces of information ($c$ and $d$). \n\nThe NEI, on the other hand, using the same 2 X 2 table cell coding, is given by:\n\n$$\nNEI =  \\frac{\\left(\\frac{a}{a+c}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{b}{b+d}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{a}{a+c}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{b}{b+d}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWhich makes clear that NEI uses information from all four cells therefore, it is insensitive to group size imbalances.\n\nOther measures of homophily could thus be constructed from the entries in the 2 X 2 table, that, like the NEI, are not sensitive to group sizes because they use all four pieces of information. \n\n#### The Point Biserial Correlation\n\nOne such measure @everett_borgatti12 [p. 565] recommend is the **point biserial correlation coefficient** ($r^{pb}$), which is given, using the cell labels in the table above, by:\n\n$$\nr^{pb} = \\frac{ad-bc}{\\sqrt{(a+c)(b+d)(a+b)(c+d))}}\n$$\n\nFrom the formula it is clear that $r^{pb}$ is positive whenever ego is connected to similar alters and disconnected from non-similar ones (the numbers in the main diagonals of the 2 X 2 table, $a$ and $d$, are big). In this way, the $r^{pb}$ works just like a correlation coefficient. A value 1.0 indicates maximum preference for same category alters, and a value closer to -1.0 indicates preference to connect with people different from ego. \n\nA function that computes $r^{pb}$ from the output of `abcd` above is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   pb.corr <- function(x) {\n      a <- x[1,1]\n      b <- x[1,2]\n      c <- x[2,1]\n      d <- x[2,2]\n   num <- (a*d - b*c)\n   den <- sqrt((a+c)*(b+d)*(a+b)*(c+d))\n   return(num/den)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor Dooku, $r^{pb}$ is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(pb.corr(abcd(\"COUNT DOOKU\", g, \"sex\")), 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.29\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich shows a positive tendency for same gender ties, net of the imbalance between men and other-gendered characters in the film. \n\nTo calculate $r^{pb}$ for the whole network, first we need to create a list containing the corresponding 2 X 2 EI tables for each node for the gender attribute:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   abcd.gender <- lapply(V(g)$name, abcd, w = g, a = \"sex\")\n   names(abcd.gender) <- V(g)$name\n   head(abcd.gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$`R2-D2`\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE     1     2\n  FALSE    1    24\n\n$`CAPTAIN TYPHO`\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE     3     0\n  FALSE   14    11\n\n$EMPEROR\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE     7     2\n  FALSE   10     9\n\n$`SENATOR ASK AAK`\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE     1     6\n  FALSE    5    16\n\n$`ORN FREE TAA`\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE     1     2\n  FALSE    5    20\n\n$`MACE WINDU`\n       same\ntied    TRUE FALSE\n  TRUE     8     2\n  FALSE    9     9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd then `sapply` the function `pb.corr` to each element of this list:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   PBC <- sapply(abcd.gender, pb.corr)\n   round(PBC, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          R2-D2   CAPTAIN TYPHO         EMPEROR SENATOR ASK AAK    ORN FREE TAA \n           0.35            0.28            0.24           -0.10            0.10 \n     MACE WINDU            YODA    KI-ADI-MUNDI     BAIL ORGANA         JAR JAR \n           0.29            0.29            0.33            0.30            0.14 \n        OBI-WAN          ANAKIN           PADME            SOLA           JOBAL \n           0.40           -0.14           -0.19            0.28            0.28 \n          RUWEE         TAUN WE         LAMA SU       BOBA FETT      JANGO FETT \n           0.28           -0.14           -0.06            0.04            0.12 \n          C-3PO            OWEN            BERU          CLIEGG     COUNT DOOKU \n           0.19           -0.20            0.14           -0.20            0.29 \n        SUN RIT          POGGLE     NUTE GUNRAY \n          -0.27            0.06            0.06 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich shows that, after accounting for group sizes, most characters display slight to moderate preferences for same-gender ties, with the exception of Anakin, Padme, Taun We, Owen, Clegg, and Sun Rit. \n\nIf we wanted to see what proportion of nodes have a same-gender preference we just type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(sum(PBC > 0)/length(PBC), 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.71\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich suggest that about 70% of the characters display a tendency to appear with same gender others (accounting for differences in the sizes of different gender groups).\n\n\nAnd at the network level, the point-biserial correlation homophily measure for gender is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(mean(PBC), 4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.1139\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich also suggests a slight preference for same gender ties in this network.\n\n#### Yule's Q\n\nThe point biserial correlation is a good measure of homiphily but comes at the expense of the simplicity of the EI index. If you favor a simpler approach that also makes us of all of the information in the 2 X 2 table, Yule's $Q$ is a good option [@borgatti_etal24, p. 159]:\n\n$$\nQ = \\frac{ad-bc}{ad+bc}\n$$\n\nLike $r^{pb}$, $Q$ works like a correlation coefficient. It is at is maximum value of $Q = 1$ when ego has no connections to different-category others ($b=0$)---maximum homophily---and it is at a minimum of $Q = -1$ when ego has no connections to same-category others ($a=0$)---maximum heterophily. \n\nA function to calculate $Q$ from the `abcd` function output is as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   y.Q <- function(x) {\n      a <- x[1,1]\n      b <- x[1,2]\n      c <- x[2,1]\n      d <- x[2,2]\n   num <- a*d - b*c\n   den <- a*d + b*c\n   return(num/den)    \n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd here are the values for the *Attack of the Clones* network:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   Q <- sapply(abcd.gender, y.Q)\n   round(Q, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n          R2-D2   CAPTAIN TYPHO         EMPEROR SENATOR ASK AAK    ORN FREE TAA \n           0.85            1.00            0.52           -0.30            0.33 \n     MACE WINDU            YODA    KI-ADI-MUNDI     BAIL ORGANA         JAR JAR \n           0.60            0.60            1.00            0.69            0.30 \n        OBI-WAN          ANAKIN           PADME            SOLA           JOBAL \n           0.70           -0.30           -0.56            0.67            0.67 \n          RUWEE         TAUN WE         LAMA SU       BOBA FETT      JANGO FETT \n           0.67           -1.00           -0.23            0.14            0.36 \n          C-3PO            OWEN            BERU          CLIEGG     COUNT DOOKU \n           0.62           -0.48            0.45           -0.48            0.60 \n        SUN RIT          POGGLE     NUTE GUNRAY \n          -1.00            0.16            0.16 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's compare four egos with extreme values on $Q$:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Q = 1](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Q = -1](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-2.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Q = -1](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-3.png){width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Q = 1](ego_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-4.png){width=768}\n:::\n\nTwo Ego Networks with Maximum and Minimum Q Values\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Captain Typhoo have an ego network that combine maximum homophily and homogeneity with respect to gender (both ego networks are composed of all men)--and therefore both receive the minimum score of $Q=-1$.\n\nTaun We, on the other hand, has an ego network that combines maximum heterophily with maximum homogeneity of alters with respect to the same attribute (she has an all-men ego network), thus receiving the maximum $Q=-1$.
