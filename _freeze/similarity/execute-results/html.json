More recent approaches from network and information science prefer to define vertex similarity using direct similarity measures based on local structural characteristics, like node neighborhoods.\n\nMathematically, similarity is a less stringent (but also less well-defined compared to distances) relation between pairs of nodes in a graph than distance, so it can be easier to work with in most applications. \n\nFor instance, similarity is required to be symmetric ($s_{ij} = s_{ji}$ for all $i$ and $j$) and most metrics have reasonable bounds (e.g., 0 for least similar and 1.0 for maximally similar). Given such a bounded similarity we can get to *dissimilarity* by subtracting one: $d_{ij} = 1 - s_{ij}$\n\n## Basic Ingredients of Vertex Similarity Metrics\n\nConsider two nodes and the set of nodes that are the immediate neighbors to each. In this case, most vertex similarity measures will make use of three pieces of information:\n\n1. The number of common neighbors $p$.\n\n1. The number of actors $q$ who are connected to node $i$ but not to node $j$.\n\n1. The number of actors $r$ who are connected to node $j$ but not to node $i$.\n\nIn the simplest case of the binary undirected graph then these are given by:\n\n$$\n   p = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_{ik} a_{jk}\n$$\n\n$$\n   q = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_{ik} (1 - a_{jk})\n$$\n\n$$\n   r = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} (1- a_{ik}) a_{jk}\n$$\n\nIn matrix form:\n\n$$\n   \\mathbf{A}(p) = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}^2\n$$\n\n$$\n   \\mathbf{A}(q) = \\mathbf{A} (1 - \\mathbf{A})\n$$\n\n$$\n   \\mathbf{A}(r) = (1 - \\mathbf{A}) \\mathbf{A}\n$$\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   library(networkdata)\n   library(igraph)\n   g.flint <- movie_267\n   g.flint <- delete_vertices(g.flint, degree(g.flint) <= 3)\n   A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(g.flint))\n   A.p <- A %*% A #common neighbors matrix\n   A.q <- A %*% (1 - A) #neighbors of i not connected to j\n   A.r <- (1 - A) %*% A #neighbors of j not connected to i\n   A.p[1:10, 1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             BAM-BAM BARNEY BETTY FELDSPAR FRED HEADMISTRESS HERDMASTER LAVA\nBAM-BAM            6      4     5        2    5            2          2    5\nBARNEY             4     13     9        1   11            5          3    7\nBETTY              5      9    13        2    9            3          4    8\nFELDSPAR           2      1     2        2    1            0          2    2\nFRED               5     11     9        1   14            4          3    9\nHEADMISTRESS       2      5     3        0    4            5          0    3\nHERDMASTER         2      3     4        2    3            0          4    4\nLAVA               5      7     8        2    9            3          4   11\nLEACH              2      3     3        1    2            2          1    2\nMORRIS             2      3     2        0    2            3          0    2\n             LEACH MORRIS\nBAM-BAM          2      2\nBARNEY           3      3\nBETTY            3      2\nFELDSPAR         1      0\nFRED             2      2\nHEADMISTRESS     2      3\nHERDMASTER       1      0\nLAVA             2      2\nLEACH            3      1\nMORRIS           1      3\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   A.q[1:10, 1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             BAM-BAM BARNEY BETTY FELDSPAR FRED HEADMISTRESS HERDMASTER LAVA\nBAM-BAM            0      2     1        4    1            4          4    1\nBARNEY             9      0     4       12    2            8         10    6\nBETTY              8      4     0       11    4           10          9    5\nFELDSPAR           0      1     0        0    1            2          0    0\nFRED               9      3     5       13    0           10         11    5\nHEADMISTRESS       3      0     2        5    1            0          5    2\nHERDMASTER         2      1     0        2    1            4          0    0\nLAVA               6      4     3        9    2            8          7    0\nLEACH              1      0     0        2    1            1          2    1\nMORRIS             1      0     1        3    1            0          3    1\n             LEACH MORRIS\nBAM-BAM          4      4\nBARNEY          10     10\nBETTY           10     11\nFELDSPAR         1      2\nFRED            12     12\nHEADMISTRESS     3      2\nHERDMASTER       3      4\nLAVA             9      9\nLEACH            0      2\nMORRIS           2      0\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   A.r[1:10, 1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             BAM-BAM BARNEY BETTY FELDSPAR FRED HEADMISTRESS HERDMASTER LAVA\nBAM-BAM            0      9     8        0    9            3          2    6\nBARNEY             2      0     4        1    3            0          1    4\nBETTY              1      4     0        0    5            2          0    3\nFELDSPAR           4     12    11        0   13            5          2    9\nFRED               1      2     4        1    0            1          1    2\nHEADMISTRESS       4      8    10        2   10            0          4    8\nHERDMASTER         4     10     9        0   11            5          0    7\nLAVA               1      6     5        0    5            2          0    0\nLEACH              4     10    10        1   12            3          3    9\nMORRIS             4     10    11        2   12            2          4    9\n             LEACH MORRIS\nBAM-BAM          1      1\nBARNEY           0      0\nBETTY            0      1\nFELDSPAR         2      3\nFRED             1      1\nHEADMISTRESS     1      0\nHERDMASTER       2      3\nLAVA             1      1\nLEACH            0      2\nMORRIS           2      0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that while $\\mathbf{A}(p)$ is necessarily symmetric, neither $q$ nor $r$ have to be. Barney has many more neighbors that Bam-Bam is not connected to than vice versa. Also note that the $\\mathbf{A}(r)$ matrix is just the transpose of the $\\mathbf{A}(q)$ matrix in the undirected case. \n\nSo the most obvious measure of similarity between two nodes is simply the number of common neighbors [@leicht_etal06]:\n\n$$\n   s_{ij} = p_{ij}\n$$\n\nWe have already seen a version of this in the directed case when talking about the HITS algorithm [@kleinberg99], which computes a spectral (eigenvector-based) ranking based on the matrices of common in and out-neighbors in a directed graph. \n\n$$\n   p^{in}_{ij} = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_{ki} a_{kj}\n$$\n\n$$\n   p^{out}_{ij} = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_{ik} a_{jk}\n$$\n\nWhich in matrix form is:\n\n$$\n   \\mathbf{A}(p^{out}) = \\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{A}\n$$\n\n$$\n   \\mathbf{A}(p^{in}) = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{A}^T\n$$\n\nIn this case, similarity can be measured *either* by the number of common in-neighbors or the number of common out-neighbors. \n\nIf the network under consideration is a (directed) **citation network** with nodes being papers and links between papers defined as a citation from paper $i$ to paper $j$, then the number of *common in-neighbors* between two papers is their **co-citation** similarity (the number of other papers that cite both papers), and the number of *common out-neighbors* is their **bibliographic coupling** similarity (the overlap in their list of references).\n\nOne problem with using unbounded quantities like the sheer number of common (in or out) neighbors to define node similarity is that they are only limited by the number of nodes in the network [@leicht_etal06]. Thus, an actor with many neighbors will end up having lots of other neighbors in common with lots of other nodes, which will mean we would count them as \"similar\" to almost everyone.\n\n## Normalized Similarity Metrics\n\nNormalized similarity metrics deal with this issue by adjusting the raw similarity based on $p$ using the number of non-shared neighbors $q$ and $r$. \n\nThe two most popular versions of normalized vertex similarity scores are the **Jaccard index** and the **cosine similarity** (sometimes also referred to as the **Salton Index**). \n\nThe Jacccard index is given by:\n\n$$\n   s_{ij} = \\frac{p}{p + q + r}\n$$\n\nWhich is the ratio of the size of the *intersection* of the neighborhoods of the two nodes (number of common neighbors) divided by the size of the *union* of the two neighborhoods. \n\nIn our example, this would be:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   J <- A.p / (A.p + A.q + A.r)\n   round(J[1:10, 1:10], 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output

Structural equivalence is an idealized version of this, obtaining whenever people share exactly the same set of neighbors.\n\nYet, similarities based on local neighborhood information only have been criticized (e.g., by @borgatti_everett92) for not quite capturing the sociological intuition behind the idea of a *role* which is usually what they are deployed for. \nThat is, two doctors don't occupy the same role because they treat the *same* set of patients (in fact, this would be weird); instead, the set of doctors occupy the same role to the extent they treat a set of actors in the same (or similar) role: Namely, patients, regardless of whether those actors are literally the same or not. \n\nThis worry led social network analysts to try to generalize the concept of structural equivalence using less stringent algebraic definition, resulting in something of a proliferation of different equivalences such as **automorphic** or **regular equivalence** [@borgatti_everett92]. \n\nUnfortunately, none of this work led (unlike the work on structural equivalence) to useful or actionable tools for data analysis, with some even concluding that some definitions of equivalence (like regular equivalence) are unlikely to be found in any interesting substantive setting. \n\nA better approach here is to use the more relaxed notion of similarity like we did above to come up with a more general definition that can capture our role-based intuitions. Note that all the similarity notions studied earlier have structural equivalence as the limiting case of maximum similarity. So they are still based on the idea that *nodes are similar to the extent they connect to the same others*. \n\nWe can generalize this idea (to deal with the doctor/patient role problem) in the following way: *nodes are similar to the extent they connect to similar others*, with the restriction that we can only use endogenous (structural connectivity) information---like with structural equivalence or common-neighbor approaches---to define everyone's similarity (no exogenous attribute stuff). \n\nAs @jeh_widom02 note, this approach does lead to a coherent generalization of the idea of similarity for nodes in graphs because we can just define similarity *recursively* and iterate through the graph until the similarity scores stop changing.^[Note the similarity (heh, heh) between this idea and the various status ranking algorithms we discussed in the previous handout.] \nMore specifically, they propose to measure the similarity between two nodes $i$ and $j$ at each time-step in the iteration using the formula:\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n   s_{ij}(t) = \\frac{\\alpha}{d_i d_j} \\sum_{k \\in N(i)} \\sum_{l \\in N(j)} s_{kl}(t-1)\n\\end{equation}\n\nSo the similarity between two nodes at step $t$ is just the sum of the pairwise similarities between each of their neighbors (computed in the previous step, $t-1$), weighted by the ratio of a free parameter $\\alpha$ (a number between zero and one) to the product of their degrees (to take a weighted average). \n\nThis measure nicely captures the idea that nodes are similar to the extent they both connect to people who are themselves similar. Note that it doesn't matter whether these neighbors are shared between the two nodes (the summation occurs over each pair of nodes in $p$ + $q$ versus $p$ + $r$ as defined earlier) or whether the set of neighbors are themselves neighbors, which deals with the doctor/patient problem. \n\nA function that implements this idea looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   SimRank.in <- function(A, C = 0.8, iter = 10) {\n      d <- colSums(A)\n      n <- nrow(A)\n      S <- diag(1, n, n)\n      rownames(S) <- rownames(A)\n      colnames(S) <- colnames(A)\n      m <- 1\n      while(m < iter) {\n          for(i in 1:n) {\n               for(j in 1:n) {\n                    if (i < j) {\n                        a <- names(which(A[, i] == 1)) \n                        b <- names(which(A[, j] == 1)) \n                        Sij <- 0\n                        for (k in a) {\n                           for (l in b) {\n                              Sij <- Sij + S[k, l] #i's similarity to j\n                           }\n                        }\n                        S[i, j] <- C/(d[i] * d[j]) * Sij\n                        S[j, i] <- C/(d[i] * d[j]) * Sij\n                    }\n               }\n          }\n         m <- m + 1\n      }\n   return(S)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that this function calculates `SimRank` using each node's in-neighbors (this doesn't matter if the graph is undirected). \n\nLet's try it out in the *Flintstones* graph using $\\alpha = 0.95$:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(g.flint))\n   S <- SimRank.in(A, 0.95)\n   round(S[, 1:5], 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                BAM-BAM BARNEY BETTY FELDSPAR FRED\nBAM-BAM            1.00   0.46  0.47     0.52 0.47\nBARNEY             0.46   1.00  0.47     0.45 0.48\nBETTY              0.47   0.47  1.00     0.48 0.47\nFELDSPAR           0.52   0.45  0.48     1.00 0.46\nFRED               0.47   0.48  0.47     0.46 1.00\nHEADMISTRESS       0.47   0.48  0.46     0.44 0.48\nHERDMASTER         0.48   0.47  0.48     0.57 0.48\nLAVA               0.48   0.47  0.47     0.49 0.48\nLEACH              0.49   0.48  0.48     0.53 0.47\nMORRIS             0.49   0.48  0.47     0.44 0.47\nMRS SLATE          0.47   0.46  0.47     0.48 0.47\nPEBBLES            0.51   0.47  0.48     0.53 0.48\nPEBBLES BAM-BAM    0.49   0.48  0.48     0.48 0.48\nPILTDOWN           0.47   0.48  0.47     0.52 0.48\nPOINDEXTER         0.47   0.47  0.48     0.51 0.47\nPYRITE             0.47   0.48  0.47     0.52 0.48\nSLATE              0.47   0.47  0.48     0.50 0.48\nWILMA              0.47   0.47  0.48     0.48 0.47\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can transform the generalized similarities to distances and plot:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   D <- dist(1- S)\n   h.res <- hclust(D, method = \"ward.D2\") #hierarchical clustering\n   plot(h.res)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](similarity_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   blocks  <- cutree(h.res, k = 6)\n   blocks\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n        BAM-BAM          BARNEY           BETTY        FELDSPAR            FRED \n              1               2               3               4               2 \n   HEADMISTRESS      HERDMASTER            LAVA           LEACH          MORRIS \n              5               4               3               6               5 \n      MRS SLATE         PEBBLES PEBBLES BAM-BAM        PILTDOWN      POINDEXTER \n              3               1               6               4               6 \n         PYRITE           SLATE           WILMA \n              4               3               3 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich returns a somewhat different role partition than the metrics relying on structural equivalence.

So we can say that this matrix gives us a basic similarity measure between nodes, namely, the common neighbors similarity:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{A}^2\n$$\n\nAnother way of seeing this is that a common neighbor defines a *path of length two* between a pair of nodes. So the number of common neighbors between two nodes is equivalent to the number of paths of length two between them. We are thus saying that the *similarity between two nodes increases as the number of paths of length two between them increases*, and that info is also recorded in the $\\mathbf{A}^2$ matrix. \n\n### The Local Path Similarity Index\n\nBut if the similarity between node pairs increases in the number of paths of length two between them, wouldn't nodes be even more similar if they also have a bunch of paths of length *three* between them? \n\n@lu_etal09 asked themselves the same question and proposed the following as a similarity metric based on paths:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{A}^2 + \\alpha \\mathbf{A}^3\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis is the so-called **local path similarity index** [@lu_etal09]. Obviously, structurally equivalent nodes will be counted as similar by this metric (lots of paths of length two between them) but also nodes indirectly connected by many paths of length three, but to a lesser extent given the discount parameter $\\alpha$ (a number between zero and one).\n\nA function that does this is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   local.path <- function(A, alpha = 0.5) {\n      A2 <- A %*% A\n      S <- A2 + alpha*(A2 %*% A)\n   return(S)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere's how the local path similarity looks in the *Flintstones* network:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(g.flint))\n   S <- local.path(A)\n   S[1:10, 1:10]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             BAM-BAM BARNEY BETTY FELDSPAR FRED HEADMISTRESS HERDMASTER LAVA\nBAM-BAM         20.0   29.5  30.5      6.5 31.5         12.5        9.5 25.0\nBARNEY          29.5   50.0  51.0     13.0 52.0         21.0       21.0 46.5\nBETTY           30.5   51.0  52.0     11.0 53.0         24.0       18.0 46.0\nFELDSPAR         6.5   13.0  11.0      3.0 13.5          4.5        5.0 10.0\nFRED            31.5   52.0  53.0     13.5 55.0         21.5       21.5 47.5\nHEADMISTRESS    12.5   21.0  24.0      4.5 21.5         13.0        6.5 21.5\nHERDMASTER       9.5   21.0  18.0      5.0 21.5          6.5       10.0 17.0\nLAVA            25.0   46.5  46.0     10.0 47.5         21.5       17.0 42.0\nLEACH            9.5   15.5  16.0      3.5 17.5          7.5        5.5 15.5\nMORRIS           8.5   13.0  15.5      2.5 13.0          8.0        3.5 12.5\n             LEACH MORRIS\nBAM-BAM        9.5    8.5\nBARNEY        15.5   13.0\nBETTY         16.0   15.5\nFELDSPAR       3.5    2.5\nFRED          17.5   13.0\nHEADMISTRESS   7.5    8.0\nHERDMASTER     5.5    3.5\nLAVA          15.5   12.5\nLEACH          6.0    4.0\nMORRIS         4.0    6.0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOf course as $\\alpha$ approaches zero, then the local path measure reduces to the number of common neighbors, while numbers closer to one count paths of length three more. \n\nAnother thing people may wonder if why not keep going and add paths of length four:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{A}^2 + \\alpha \\mathbf{A}^3 + \\alpha^2 \\mathbf{A}^4\n\\end{equation}\n\nOr paths of length whatever:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{A}^2 + \\alpha \\mathbf{A}^3 + \\alpha^2 \\mathbf{A}^4 ... + \\alpha^{k-2} \\mathbf{A}^k\n$$\n\nWhere $k$ is the length of the maximum path considered. @lu_etal09 argue that these higher order paths don't matter, so maybe we don't have to worry about them.\n\n### The Katz Similarity\n\nAnother issue is that there was already an all-paths similarity measure in existence, one developed by the mathematical social scientist Leo @katz53 in the 1950s (!). \n\nThe basic idea was to use linear algebra tricks to solve:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k A^k\n$$\n\nWhich would theoretically count the paths of *all possible lengths* between two nodes while discounting the contribution of the longer paths in proportion to their length (as $k$ gets bigger, with $\\alpha$ a number between zero and one, $\\alpha^k$ gets smaller and smaller).\n\nLinear algebra hocus-pocus (non-technical explainer [here](https://olizardo.github.io/networks-textbook/lesson-sna-status.html#a-mathy-interlude)) turns the above infinite sum into the more tractable:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\alpha A)^{-1}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the **identity matrix** (a matrix of all zeros except that it has the number one in each diagonal cell) of the same dimensions as the original. Raising the result of the subtraction in parentheses to minus one indicates the **matrix inverse** operation (most matrices are invertible, unless they are weird).\n\nA function to compute the **Katz similarity** between all node pairs is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   katz.sim <- function(A, min.alpha = 0.05) {\n      I <- diag(nrow(A)) #creating identity matrix\n      alpha <- runif(1, min = min.alpha, max = 1/eigen(A)$values[1])\n      S <- solve(I - alpha * A) \n      return(S)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor technical reasons (e.g., guarantee that the infinite sum converges) we need to choose $\\alpha$ to be a number larger than zero but smaller than the reciprocal of the first eigenvalue of the matrix. Hence we just pick a random value in that interval in line 3 (set the seed to get reproducible answers). Line 4 computes the actual Katz similarity using the native `R` function `solve` to find the relevant matrix inverse.^[See [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/matlib/vignettes/inv-ex1.html) for an explainer of the matrix inverse in general and its computation in `R`.] \n\nIn the *Flintstones* network the Katz similarity looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   set.seed(456)\n   S <- katz.sim(A)\n   round(S[1:10, 1:10], 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             BAM-BAM BARNEY BETTY FELDSPAR FRED HEADMISTRESS HERDMASTER LAVA\nBAM-BAM         1.03   0.08  0.09     0.01 0.09         0.01       0.01 0.03\nBARNEY          0.08   1.07  0.11     0.07 0.12         0.03       0.08 0.10\nBETTY           0.09   0.11  1.07     0.01 0.11         0.08       0.02 0.11\nFELDSPAR        0.01   0.07  0.01     1.01 0.07         0.00       0.01 0.01\nFRED            0.09   0.12  0.11     0.07 1.07         0.02       0.08 0.11\nHEADMISTRESS    0.01   0.03  0.08     0.00 0.02         1.02       0.00 0.08\nHERDMASTER      0.01   0.08  0.02     0.01 0.08         0.00       1.02 0.02\nLAVA            0.03   0.10  0.11     0.01 0.11         0.08       0.02 1.06\nLEACH           0.01   0.02  0.02     0.00 0.07         0.01       0.01 0.07\nMORRIS          0.01   0.02  0.07     0.00 0.01         0.01       0.00 0.01\n             LEACH MORRIS\nBAM-BAM       0.01   0.01\nBARNEY        0.02   0.02\nBETTY         0.02   0.07\nFELDSPAR      0.00   0.00\nFRED          0.07   0.01\nHEADMISTRESS  0.01   0.01\nHERDMASTER    0.01   0.00\nLAVA          0.07   0.01\nLEACH         1.01   0.01\nMORRIS        0.01   1.01\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Degree-Weighted Katz Similarity (AKA Leich-Holme-Newman)\n\n@leicht_etal06 argue that the Katz approach is fine and dandy as a similarity measure, but note that is an unweighted index (like the raw number of common neighbors). This means that nodes with large degree will end up being \"similar\" to a buch of other nodes in the graph, just because they have lots of paths of length whatever between them and those nodes.\n\n@leicht_etal06 propose a \"fix\" for this weakness in the Katz similarity, resulting in the matrix linear algebra equivalent of a degree-normalized similarity measure like the Jaccard or Cosine. \n\nSo instead of Katz they suggest we compute:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{D}^{-1} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha A}{\\lambda_1} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{D}^{-1}\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathbf{D}$ is a matrix containing the degrees of each node along the diagonal. The inverse of this matrix $\\mathbf{D}^{-1}$ will contain the *reciprocal* of each degree $1/k_i$ along the diagonals. $\\lambda_1$, on the other hand, is just the first eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. \n\nSo, the **LHN Similarity** is just the Katz similarity weighted by the degree of the sender and receiver node along each path, further discounting paths featuring high-degree nodes at either or both ends. \n\nWhich leads to the function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   LHN.sim <- function(A, alpha = 0.9) {\n      D <- solve(diag(rowSums(A))) #inverse of degree matrix\n      lambda <- eigen(A)$values[1] #first eigenvalue of adjacency matrix\n      S <- D %*% solve((alpha * A)/lambda) %*% D #LHN index\n      rownames(S) <- rownames(A)\n      colnames(S) <- colnames(A)\n      return(S)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd the *Flintstones* result:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   S <- LHN.sim(A)\n   round(S[, 1:5], 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                BAM-BAM BARNEY BETTY FELDSPAR  FRED\nBAM-BAM           -0.09   0.01  0.01    -0.16 -0.01\nBARNEY             0.01  -0.02  0.00     0.11  0.01\nBETTY              0.01   0.00 -0.04    -0.48  0.00\nFELDSPAR          -0.16   0.11 -0.48    -2.55  0.25\nFRED              -0.01   0.01  0.00     0.25 -0.01\nHEADMISTRESS       0.20   0.05 -0.13    -2.96 -0.05\nHERDMASTER         0.16   0.08  0.10     0.07 -0.07\nLAVA               0.00  -0.02 -0.02    -0.42  0.02\nLEACH             -0.27  -0.10  0.04     2.01  0.09\nMORRIS            -0.25  -0.03  0.12     1.90  0.03\nMRS SLATE         -0.05   0.01  0.04     0.74 -0.01\nPEBBLES            0.19   0.01  0.01    -0.16 -0.01\nPEBBLES BAM-BAM    0.03   0.00  0.03     0.16  0.00\nPILTDOWN           0.00   0.00  0.00    -0.35  0.00\nPOINDEXTER         0.01   0.03  0.04     0.66 -0.02\nPYRITE             0.00   0.00  0.00    -0.35  0.00\nSLATE             -0.08  -0.01  0.04     0.91  0.01\nWILMA              0.01   0.00  0.02     0.09  0.00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that as @leicht_etal06 discuss, the entries in the **LHN** version of the similarity $\\mathbf{S}$ can be either positive or negative.
