This approach does not have to iterate between binary divisions based on a single (leading) eigenvector, but can instead use multiple eigenvectors at once to partition the data into any desired number of clusters. \n\nThis general approach to community detection is sometimes referred to as **spectral clustering**.^[Not as a reference to ghosts, but because the eigendecomposition of a matrix is sometimes also called the **spectral decomposition**.]\n\n## Spectral Clustering Using the Eigenvectors of the Laplacian\n\nThe issue then becomes, *which* matrix should we use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of? As suggested by @vonluxburg07, an obvious candidate is what is called the **graph Laplacian** ($\\mathbf{L}$), which is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{D} - \\mathbf{A}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\mathbf{D}$ is the graph's **degree matrix** a matrix with the degree vector of the graph along the diagonals and zeros everywhere else. \n\nLike the modularity matrix, the $\\mathbf{L}$ matrix is doubly-centered (rows and columns sum to zero), which means, via some math other smarter people have worked out, that, if $\\mathbf{A}$ is connected, one of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{L}$ is guaranteed to be zero.^[If $\\mathbf{A}$ is not connected there will be as many zero eigenvalues in the eigendecomposition of $\\mathbf{L}$ as there are components in $\\mathbf{A}$.] \n\nThe other interesting thing is that the second smallest (non-zero) eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{L}$ (sometimes called the **Fiedler vector**) provides an optimal (e.g., minimizing the number of cross-community edges) two-community partition of the graph (just like we saw the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix does).\n\nIf we want to check for the existence of multiple groups, therefore, what we need to do is to create a new $n \\times k$ matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ composed of the $k$ eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{L}$ associated with the $k$ *smallest* eigenvalues, arranged from smallest to biggest. \n\nWe then normalize the node-specific row-vector of values of the$\\mathbf{U}$ matrix (e.g., using the Euclidean norm), and the use normalized $\\mathbf{U}$ matrix, which is an embedding of the node set of the graph in an k-dimensional Euclidean space, as input to a k-means algorithm with a known number of clusters [@fouss_etal16, p. 320]. \n\nLet's see how that would work. Let's load the `law_friends` data from the `networkdata` package containing information on the friendship nominations of 68 lawyers in a firm. We have already analyzed these data using other community detection algorithms in a previous handout. The original data are directed, so we constrain them to be undirected and remove nodes with degree less than two:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   library(networkdata)\n   library(igraph)\n   g <- law_friends\n   g <- as_undirected(g, mode = \"collapse\")\n   g <- subgraph(g, degree(g)>=2) #removing low degree nodes\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then write a function called `ratio.cut` that accomplishes the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix described earlier. It looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   ratio.cut <- function(x, k = 6) {\n         A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(x))\n         D <- diag(degree(x))\n         n <- vcount(x)\n         L <- D - A\n         eig.L <- eigen(L)\n         b <- n - k\n         e <- n - 1\n         U <- matrix(eig.L$vectors[, b:e], nrow = n, ncol = k)\n         if (k > 1) {\n            U <- U[, k:1] #re-ordering columns from smallest to biggest\n            }\n         for (i in 1:nrow(U)) {\n            U[i, ] <- U[i, ]/norm(as.matrix(U[i, ]), type = \"E\")\n            }\n      return(U)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis function takes a graph as input and produces the $\\mathbf{U}$ matrix with $n$ rows and $k$ columns, with $k=6$ by default. It first computes the adjacency matrix (line 2), then the degree matrix (line 3), then the Laplacian matrix (line 5). It then computes the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian (line 6), row normalizes the values taken by the eigenvectors corresponding to the $k$ smallest eigenvalues in lines 10-13 (reverse-ordered from smallest to biggest in line 9), and returns the resulting matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ in line 14.\n\nLet's see the function at work:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   U <- ratio.cut(g)\n   round(U, 2)[1:10, ]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]  [,5]  [,6]\n [1,]  0.08  0.34  0.66  0.37 -0.54  0.13\n [2,]  0.07  0.29  0.60  0.37 -0.53  0.37\n [3,]  0.47  0.13  0.08 -0.87  0.03  0.04\n [4,]  0.34  0.38  0.71  0.16 -0.45  0.10\n [5,]  0.57  0.26  0.06 -0.78  0.00  0.01\n [6,]  0.58 -0.76 -0.21  0.20 -0.05  0.03\n [7,]  0.37  0.20 -0.01 -0.90  0.08  0.03\n [8,] -0.02  0.33  0.65  0.41 -0.55 -0.01\n [9,]  0.14  0.37  0.67  0.36 -0.52  0.04\n[10,]  0.05  0.36  0.66  0.42 -0.50  0.06\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich shows the corresponding values of $\\mathbf{U}$ for each node across the six eigenvectors of the Laplacian we selected. \n\nNow, the basic idea is to treat each of the normalized scores along the six eigenvectors as if they were \"variables\" or \"features\" in a standard k-means clustering problem. The algorithm will then group nodes based on how similar their scores are on each six-dimensional vector. Similar nodes will correspond to communities (k-means clusters) in our data. \n\nK-means clustering requires knowing how many groups we want in advance (differently from hierarchical clustering). Since we don't know which is the best community partition beforehand, we instead compute a bunch of partitions and check the modularity of each. \n\nThe following function computes cluster assignments of the nodes in the graph up to ten partitions (starting from the minimum two):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   k.cuts <- function(x, max = 9) {\n      clus <- list()\n      for (i in 1:max) {\n         set.seed(456) #setting seed because kmeans uses random starting nodes for cluster centroids\n         k <- i + 1\n         clus[[i]] <- kmeans(x, k)$cluster\n         }\n      return(clus)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis function takes the $\\mathbf{U}$ matrix as input and returns a nine-element list (with vectors of length $n$ as its elements) of cluster assignments for each node in the graph, corresponding to partitions $k = \\{2, 3, \\ldots 10\\}$ respectively. \n\nLet's see the clustering function at work:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   clus <- k.cuts(U)\n   clus\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n [1] 2 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2\n[39] 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n[[2]]\n [1] 3 3 1 3 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 1 1 1 3 1 3 3 3\n[39] 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n[[3]]\n [1] 3 3 4 3 4 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 3 3 3 4 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 4 3 3 4 4 4 3 1 3 3 3\n[39] 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n[[4]]\n [1] 3 3 5 3 5 5 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 3 4 4 4 4 3 1 3 3 3\n[39] 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n[[5]]\n [1] 3 3 5 3 5 5 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 1 3 3 3 3 3 4 3 3 5 3 4 6 6 6 3 1 4 3 3\n[39] 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n[[6]]\n [1] 3 3 5 3 5 5 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 1 3 3 3 3 3 4 3 3 5 3 4 6 6 6 3 1 4 3 3\n[39] 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 6 7 2 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n[[7]]\n [1] 8 8 5 8 5 5 5 8 8 8 8 8 8 5 8 8 8 5 1 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 5 8 4 6 6 6 3 1 3 3 3\n[39] 3 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 1 2 8 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 6 7 2 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n[[8]]\n [1] 8 8 5 8 5 5 5 8 8 8 8 8 8 5 8 8 8 5 1 8 8 8 8 8 4 8 8 5 8 4 6 6 6 3 1 3 3 3\n[39] 3 2 2 3 7 1 3 2 1 1 2 8 2 2 2 7 1 1 1 1 7 6 7 2 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n[[9]]\n [1]  3  3  5  3  5  5  5  3  3  3  3  3  3  5  8  3  3  5  1  3  3  3  3  3  4\n[26]  3  3  5  3  4  6  6  6 10  1 10 10 10 10  2  2 10  7  1 10  2  1  1  2  8\n[51]  2  2  2  7  1  1  1  1  7  6  7  2  9  9  9  9  9  9\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGreat!

Another approach is to use a (degree) normalized version of the same matrix $\\mathbf{\\hat{L}}$, defined as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\hat{L}} = \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\n\nWhere everything else is as before and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix (an $n \\times n$ matrix with ones along the diagonals and zero everywhere else), and $\\mathbf{D}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ is a matrix containing the inverse of the square root of degrees of each node ($1/\\sqrt{k_i}$) in the diagonals and zeros everywhere else. \n\nWe can just adapt our previous `ratio.cut` function code to perform this new job:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   norm.ratio.cut <- function(x, k = 6) {\n         A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(x))\n         n <- vcount(x)\n         I <- diag(1, n, n)\n         D <- diag(1/sqrt(degree(x)))\n         L <- I - (D %*% A %*% D)\n         eig.L <- eigen(L)\n         b <- n - k\n         e <- n - 1\n         U <- matrix(eig.L$vectors[, b:e], nrow = n, ncol = k)\n         if (k > 1) {\n            U <- U[, k:1] #re-ordering columns from smallest to biggest\n            }         \n         for (i in 1:nrow(U)) {\n            U[i, ] <- U[i, ]/norm(as.matrix(U[i, ]), type = \"E\")\n            }\n      return(U)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhere we just have to modify the way we define the $\\mathbf{D}$ and $\\mathbf{L}$ matrices in lines 5 and 6 respectively, after creating the $\\mathbf{I}$ matrix in line 4. \n\nNow let's see if the normalized cut can help us finds some communities:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   U <- norm.ratio.cut(g)\n   clus <- k.cuts(U)\n   mod.res <- mod.check(g, clus)\n   round(mod.res, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10 \n0.250 0.316 0.320 0.352 0.350 0.331 0.293 0.284 0.246 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-friends2 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Five Community Solution](spectral_files/figure-html/fig-friends2-1.png){#fig-friends2-1 width=1152}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Six Community Solution](spectral_files/figure-html/fig-friends2-2.png){#fig-friends2-2 width=1152}\n:::\n\nClustering of Nodes in the Law Firm Friendship Network Using the Normalized Ratio Cut\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see, the normalized ratio cut approach performs almost as well as the ratio cut approach in terms of the maximum modularity it finds ($Q = 0.35$), but suggests a finer grained partition, with the maximum at either five or six communities. \n\nThe resulting node clusters are shown in @fig-friends2-1 and @fig-friends2-2. \n\n## Spectral Clustering Using the Eigenvectors of the *Degree-Normalized* Laplacian\n\nAn alternative version of the normalized Laplacian is given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\bar{L}} = \\mathbf{D}^{-1}\\mathbf{L}\n$$\n\nWhich is just the original Laplacian as defined earlier with each entry divided by the degree of the corresponding node in that row. \n\nA function that extracts the relevant eigenvectors of this version of the normalized Laplacian goes as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   d.norm.ratio.cut <- function(x, k = 6) {\n         A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(x))\n         n <- vcount(x)\n         I <- diag(1, n, n)\n         D <- diag(degree(x))\n         L <- solve(D) %*% (D - A)\n         eig.L <- eigen(L)\n         b <- n - k\n         e <- n - 1\n         U <- matrix(eig.L$vectors[, b:e], nrow = n, ncol = k)\n         if (k > 1) {\n            U <- U[, k:1] #re-ordering columns from smallest to biggest\n            }         \n         for (i in 1:nrow(U)) {\n            U[i, ] <- U[i, ]/norm(as.matrix(U[i, ]), type = \"E\")\n            }\n      return(U)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhere, once again, we only need to modify a couple of lines (5 and 6) from before to compute the new version of $\\mathbf{L}$. \n\nTo see the quality of the partitions obtained via this method, we just type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   clus <- k.cuts(d.norm.ratio.cut(g))\n   mod.res <- mod.check(g, clus)\n   round(mod.res, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10 \n0.250 0.355 0.339 0.327 0.340 0.331 0.294 0.287 0.252 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe degree-normalized Laplacian once again prefers the three-community partition, but also shows that the *six* community partition produces a high-quality clustering.

That is, we cluster the graph by embedding the nodes in a set of dimensions defined by the eigendecomposition of $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nThe main difference is that rather than using the eigenvectors corresponding to the *smallest* eigenvalues (as we did with $\\mathbf{L}$) we proceed in more typical fashion (as done with PCA and CA) and choose the eigenvectors corresponding to the *largest* ones. \n\nThis approach, once again, only requires small modifications to the one we used for the Laplacian:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   mod.mat.cut <- function(x, k = 2) {\n         A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(x))\n         n <- vcount(x)\n         d <- as.matrix(degree(x))\n         B <- A - (d %*% t(d))/sum(A)\n         eig.B <- eigen(B)\n         U <- eig.B$vectors[, 1:k]\n         for (i in 1:nrow(U)) {\n            U[i, ] <- U[i, ]/norm(as.matrix(U[i, ]), type = \"E\")\n            }\n      return(U)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe key difference here is that we compute the modularity matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ rather than $\\mathbf{L}$ from the adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ in line 5; we then plug $\\mathbf{B}$ into the `eigen` function and proceed with normalizing in the same way as before. \n\nAnother difference is that rather than using a large number of eigenvalues (e.g., $k = 6$), as we did when we were picking from the smallest ones, we now go for parsimony and pick a small rank (two-dimensional) representation of the original modularity matrix ($k = 2$).\n\nLet's see how this works:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   U <- mod.mat.cut(g)\n   clus <- k.cuts(U)\n   mod.res <- mod.check(g, clus)\n   round(mod.res, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9    10 \n0.264 0.366 0.331 0.317 0.306 0.304 0.224 0.187 0.166 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that the three-cluster solution does really well modularity-wise ($Q = 0.37$), however, the four cluster solution also seems promising.
