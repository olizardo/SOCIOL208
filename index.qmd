## Class Description

This class is an introductory graduate-level seminar focused on techniques in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The seminar covers the most common data analytic tasks that people engage in when analyzing "network data." What is network data? What counts as network data is itself a point of contention---as we will see below, for some people all data is network data---but let us say for the sake of this class that network data is data in which the unit of analysis is the relation or the interaction between at least *two* actors or objects, and the data come typically in arrange in this "dyadic" form. At the end of the course, you will be familiar with (and will have acquired some practice) the basic techniques used to analyze social network data.

## Course Content

### Basic SNA

So, what are the things that people usually do when they have network data? Well, they typically want to figure out basic statistics about the interaction system formed by the set of dyads in the data. This task requires computing basic network quantities like the number of nodes and the number of links between entities as well as more advanced statistics based on representing the network as a **graph** (like the average path length, number of components, etc., all notions we will cover in the first week of class). 

### Centrality and Prestige

Then come the things that almost everyone is interested in computing when using network data to answer social science questions. Primarily, this includes measures and indices of a node's **position** in the network (e.g., differentiating between more or less central or less prestigious nodes), which we will cover in weeks 2 and 3. 

### Classes and Communities

After taking a break in Week 4, we move to the common case of people wanting to see if the nodes in the network fall into definable **clusters** or **classes**, where the criterion for being in the same cluster is based on how they connect to other nodes. Here, we want to find clusters of nodes that are **similar** to one another by some graph theoretic criterion and partition the graph into clusters based on that criterion. 

Week 6 is dedicated to the next thing we may want to do, and that is to see if we can uncover clumps of *densely connected nodes* in the network indicating some natural partition into **subgroups** or **communities**, defined as nodes that interact more among themselves than they do among those outside the group, leading to the myriad of group and community detection techniques designed to partition a graph into clusters based on connectivity. 

### Two-Mode and Ego Networks

The next two weeks are dedicated to the analysis of some pretty common "non-standard" types of network data (e.g., data that doesn't use the dyadic relation between objects of the same type as the analytic unit). The first is "ego networks," where we first sample a set of units (egos), and then within each ego, we ask about a subset of their contacts. These data come closest to the traditional data in social science, so various standard techniques apply (with some twists). 

The second type of non-standard network data comes in a "two-mode" form, in which some sets of objects are linked to objects of a different set, but there is no data on the links between objects of the same set. Standard cases by variables data in surveys are two-mode data, as is any data collecting memberships or interactions between persons and objects (like attendance or buying books on Amazon). We will see that due to a net mathematical trick, we can use the standard panoply of techniques we learned in weeks 1-6 on this type of two-mode network (which means that we can do SNA on all types of data, not just network data).

### Probabilistic Models of Networks

The bulk of SNA assumes that the ties exist as recorded in the data. A novel approach to networks is to make the ties the dependent variable and thus see the observed network data as a realization of some stochastic process governing the probability that two objects will be linked and thus one that can be modeled statistically. We analyze the theory and methods behind this approach to thinking of network structure from the bottom up and also cover some models designed to treat networks as composed of "relational events" and thus model how events that link entities in networks evolve.
