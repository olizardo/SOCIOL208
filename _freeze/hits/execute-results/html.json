The same goes for status as reflected in a distributive model through the network. \n\nConsider two ways of showing your status in a system governed by directed relations (like advice). You can be highly sought after by others (be an \"authority\"), or you can be discerning in who you seek advice from, preferably seeking out people who are also sought after (e.g., be a \"hub\" pointing to high-quality others). \n\nThese two forms of status are mutually defining [@bonacich_lloyd01]. The top authorities are those who are sought after by the top hubs, and the top hubs are the ones who seek the top authorities! \n\nSo this leads to a doubling of the Bonacich prestige status accounting equation:\n\n$$  \n   x^h_i = \\sum_j a_{ij} x^a_j\n$$\n\n$$\n   x^a_i = \\sum_i a_{ij} x^h_i\n$$\n\nWhich says that the hub score $x^h$ of a node is the sum of the authority scores $x^a$ of the nodes they point to (sum over $j$; the outdegree), and the authority score of a node is the sum of the hub scores of the nodes that point to it (sum over $i$; the indegree). \n\nSo we need to make our [status game](prestige.qmd) a bit more complicated (but not too much) to account for this duality:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   status2 <- function(w) {\n     a <- rep(1/nrow(w), nrow(w))  #initializing authority scores\n     d <- 1 #initializing delta\n     k <- 0 #initializing counter\n     while (d >= 1e-10) {\n         o.a <- a #old authority scores\n         h <- w %*% o.a #new hub scores a function of previous authority scores of their out-neighbors\n         h <- h/norm(h, type = \"E\")\n         a <- t(w) %*% h #new authority scores a function of current hub scores of their in-neighbors\n         a <- a/norm(a, type = \"E\")\n         d <- abs(sum(abs(o.a) - abs(a))) #delta between old and new authority scores\n         k <- k + 1\n         }\n   return(list(h = as.vector(h), a = as.vector(a), k = k))\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nEverything is like [our previous](prestige.qmd) `status1` function except now we are keeping track of two mutually defining scores `a` and `h`. We first initialize the authority scores by setting them to the value of $1/n$ (where $n$ is the number of nodes or the number of rows in the adjacency matrix) in line 2. We then initialize the $\\delta$ difference and $k$ counter in lines 3-4. The `while` loop in lines 5-13 then updates the hub scores (to be the sum of the authority scores of each out-neighbor) in line 7 normalize them in line 8 and update the new authority scores to be the sum (across each in-neighbor) of these new hub scores, which are then themselves normalized in line 10. \n\nSo at each step $t$, the authority and hub scores are calculated like this:\n\n$$  \n   x^h_i(t) = \\sum_j a_{ij} x^a_j(t-1)\n$$\n\n$$\n   x^a_i(t) = \\sum_j a^T_{ij} x^h_j(t)\n$$\n\nWhere $a^T_{ij}$ is the corresponding entry in the *transpose* of the adjacency matrix (`t(w)` in line 9 of the above function).\n\nAs you may have guessed this is just an implementation of the \"HITS\" algorithm developed by @kleinberg99.^[HITS is an acronym for the unfortunate and impossible to remember name \"Hypertext Induced Topic Selection\" reflecting the origins the approach in web-based information science.]\n\nThe results for the Krackhardt advice network are:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   library(networkdata)\n   library(igraph)\n   g <- ht_advice\n   A <- as.matrix(as_adjacency_matrix(g))\n   hits.res1 <- status2(A)\n   round(hits.res1$a/max(hits.res1$a), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.782 1.000 0.356 0.496 0.330 0.644 0.684 0.711 0.290 0.615 0.769 0.498\n[13] 0.323 0.677 0.267 0.570 0.645 0.871 0.323 0.589 0.776\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(hits.res1$h/max(hits.res1$h), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.370 0.176 0.841 0.709 0.835 0.065 0.492 0.490 0.773 0.672 0.206 0.122\n[13] 0.331 0.279 1.000 0.274 0.313 0.800 0.581 0.687 0.600\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich are equivalent to using the `igraph` function `hits_scores`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   ha <- hits_scores(g, scale = TRUE)\n   round(ha$authority, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.782 1.000 0.356 0.496 0.330 0.644 0.684 0.711 0.290 0.615 0.769 0.498\n[13] 0.323 0.677 0.267 0.570 0.645 0.871 0.323 0.589 0.776\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(ha$hub, 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.370 0.176 0.841 0.709 0.835 0.065 0.492 0.490 0.773 0.672 0.206 0.122\n[13] 0.331 0.279 1.000 0.274 0.313 0.800 0.581 0.687 0.600\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the just like the `status2` function, the `igraph` function `hits_scores` returns the two sets of scores as elements of a `list`, so we need to access them using the `$` operator on the object that we store the results in (in this case `ha`). We also set the `scale` argument to `TRUE` so that the scores are normalized by the maximum. \n\n## Hubs, Authorities and Eigenvectors\n\nRecall that both the [eigenvector](prestige.qmd) and [PageRank](pagerank.qmd) status scores computed via the network status distribution game routine ended up being equivalent to the leading eigenvector of a network proximity matrix (the adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and the probability matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ respectively).

Consider the subgraph shown in @fig-sub, which contains nodes 2 and 11 from the Krackhardt advice network and their respective neighbors: \n\nIf these nodes where papers, then we would say that both 2 and 11 point to a common third node 1. In an information network, the papers that other papers point to are their common references. Therefore the number of *common out-neighbors* of two nodes is is called the **bibliographic coupling** score between the two papers. In the same way, we can see that 2 and 11 are pointed to by a common third neighbor 21. The number of *common in-neighbors* between two-papers is called their **co-citation** score.\n\nBoth the bibliographic coupling and the co-citation scores get at two ways that nodes can be similar in a directed graph. In the social context of advice seeking, for instance, two people can be similar if they seek advice from the same others, or two people can be similar if they are sought after for advice by the same others. \n\nThe $\\mathbf{M}^h$ and $\\mathbf{M}^a$ matrices, therefore are two (unweighted) similarity matrices between the nodes in a directed graph.

Instead of dividing by the maximum, we divide by the sum, so that the vector of SALSA hub and authority scores sum to 1.0. \n\nThe reason for this is that, as @fouss_etal04 explain, these numbers have a straightforward interpretation in terms of the *probability* that a [random walker](pagerank.qmd) in the network will find itself in that particular node, when the walker goes from hub -> authority -> hub -> authority (e.g., never going from hub to hub or authority to authority) using the entries in the `P.a` and `P.h` matrices to determine the probability of jumping from hub $i$ to authority $j$ and vice versa. Thus, the higher the probability the more \"central\" the specific hub or authority is, just like the random walk interpretation of the PageRank scores.\n\n<!--We could, of course, create \"Google\" versions of these matrices and compute our SALSA version of the hub and authorities scores by incorporating a damping factor, teleportation, and all the rest [@rafiei_mendelzon00]. -->\n\n## HITS as Principal Components Analysis\n\n@saerens_fouss05 argue that there is an intimate relationship between the HITS dual ranking scores and one of the most widely used multivariate analysis techniques, Principal Components Analysis (PCA). In fact, they argue that HITS is just PCA on an *uncentered data matrix* (which in the this case is the network's adjacency matrix). Technically we could also just argue that PCA is just HITS on a **centered adjacency matrix**, as we will see right now.\n\nLet's see how this works. First, let's create a *centered* version of the network adjacency matrix. To center a typical data matrix (e.g., of individuals in the rows by variables in the columns) we subtract the *column mean* (the average score of all individuals on that variable) from each individual's score.^[Note that the column mean of the adjacency matrix will be equivalent to each individual's **indegree** (the sum of the columns) divided by the total number of nodes in the network ($k^{in}/n$), which is kind of a normalized degree centrality score, except the usual normalization is to divide by $n-1$ (so as to have a maximum of 1.0) as we saw in our discussion of [centrality](centrality.qmd).] \n\nTo do our centering, we can use the native `R` function `apply` with the second argument set to `2` which means \"apply this function to the columns of the matrix\" (setting the argument to `1` would apply it to the rows):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   A.c <- apply(A, 2, function(x) {x - mean(x)})\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, the function we `apply` to each column of the adjacency matrix `A` just takes each column vector and subtracts the mean from each of the entries of the same vector (`x - mean(x)`).\n\nWe can use the `colMeans` function to check that the column means of the centered adjacency matrix are indeed zero:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(colMeans(A.c), 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have our column-centered the adjacency matrix, all we need to do is play our HITS status game on it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   hits.res <- status2(A.c)\n   h2 <- hits.res$h\n   a2 <- hits.res$a\n   names(h2) <- 1:21\n   names(a2) <- 1:21\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then use the function below to normalize each status score to be within the minus one to plus one interval and have mean zero:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   norm.v <- function(x) {\n      x <- x - min(x)\n      x <- x/max(x)\n      x <- x - mean(x)\n      return(x)\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe first thing the function does (line 2) is subtract the minimum value from the vector (which becomes zero), in line 3 we divided by the maximum (which becomes one), and in line 4 we subtract the mean from each value.\n\nAnd the resulting normalized hub and authority scores for each node in the Krackhardt managers advice network are:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(norm.v(h2), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10     11 \n-0.162 -0.374  0.318  0.241  0.364 -0.429 -0.027 -0.117  0.239  0.334 -0.335 \n    12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     21 \n-0.421 -0.160 -0.339  0.571 -0.240 -0.295  0.385  0.105  0.206  0.134 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(norm.v(a2), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10     11 \n 0.052 -0.155 -0.031 -0.177 -0.150 -0.020 -0.555  0.415 -0.199  0.106  0.411 \n    12     13     14     15     16     17     18     19     20     21 \n 0.031  0.020  0.215 -0.233  0.232  0.314 -0.056  0.020  0.343 -0.585 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@saerens_fouss05 show that these are the same scores we would obtain from a simple PCA of the regular old adjacency matrix.

The leading eigenvector is that associated with the largest eigenvalue (if the matrix contains one).\n\nSo all that this is telling us is that the first eigenvector of the un-transposed versions of the SALSA hub and authority matrices is pretty useless because it assigns everyone the same status score.\n\nBut @fouss_etal04 note, like we did at the beginning, that a [matrix has many eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs](eigen.qmd) and that perhaps the *second* leading eigenvector is not that useless; this is the eigenvector associated with the *second* largest eigenvalue.\n\nHow do we get that vector? Well, as always, there is a mathematical workaround. The trick is to create a new matrix that removes the influence of that first (useless) eigenvector and then play our status game on *that* matrix. \n\nTo do that, let's create a matrix that is equal to the original useless eigenvector times its own transpose.

two-dimensional space. In the plot nodes are colored by the *difference* between their SALSA hub and authority scores such that nodes with positive scores (hub score larger than their authority scores) appear in blue and nodes with negative scores (authority scores larger than their hub scores) appear in red. \n\n\n::: {#fig-ca .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![CA Coordinates](hits_files/figure-html/fig-ca-1.png){#fig-ca-1 width=768}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![PCA Coordinates](hits_files/figure-html/fig-ca-2.png){#fig-ca-2 width=768}\n:::\n\nKrackhardt's managers advice network (top hubs in blue and top authorities in red)\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that the CA hub score places the \"hubbiest\" of hubs (blue nodes) in the lower-right quadrant of the diagram, with positive CA hub scores and negative CA authority scores (this last multiplied by minus one from the ones shown above). Note from @tbl-ha, that the nodes in this region (e.g. {15, 5, 3, 19, 9, 13}) all have large SALSA hub scores and very low SALSA authority scores. \n\nIn the same way, the most authoritative of authorities (red nodes) appear in the upper-left side, with negative CA hub scores and positive CA authority scores. Note that nodes in this region have very large SALSA authority scores and very low SALSA hub scores. \n\nFinally, note that nodes in the upper-right quadrant of the diagram (e.g. {21, 7, 4, 18, 10}) are \"ambidextrous\" nodes, showcasing relatively large scores as both hubs and authorities according to SALSA. \n\nThus what the CA scores seem to be doing is separating out the purest examples of hubs and authorities in the network from those who play both roles. \n\nNote that as shown in @fig-ca-2, we get an even stronger separation between hubs and authorities when using the PCA scores to place nodes in a common space, with all the authorities (except nodes 7 and 21) to the upper left, and the hubs on the right-hand side of the plot. So  the PCA scores reflect the same distinction between hub and authority status as the CA scores. \n\n## A Hybrid PageRank/HITS Approach\n@borodin_etal05 argue that perhaps a better approach to combining PageRank and HITS is to normalize only *one* of the scores by degree while leaving the other score alone. \n\n### Picky Hubs\n\nFor instance, in some settings, it might make more sense to assign more authority to nodes that are pointed to by *picky hubs* (e.g., people who seek advice from a few select others), and discount the authority scores of nodes that are pointed to by *indiscriminate* hubs (people who seek advice from everyone).\n\nWe can do this by changing the way we compute the hub score of each node. Instead of just summing the authority scores of all the nodes they point to (like in regular HITS) we instead take the *average* of the authority scores of all nodes they point to. We then feed this average back to the authority score calculation. \n\nThis entails slightly modifying the HITS status game as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   status3 <- function(w) {\n     a <- rep(1, nrow(w))  #initializing authority scores\n     d.o <- rowSums(w) #outdegree of each node\n     d <- 1 #initializing delta\n     k <- 0 #initializing counter\n     while (d >= 1e-10) {\n         o.a <- a #old authority scores\n         h <- (w %*% o.a) * 1/d.o #new hub scores a function of previous authority scores of their out-neighbors\n         h <- h/norm(h, type = \"E\")\n         a <- t(w) %*% h #new authority scores a function of current hub scores of their in-neighbors\n         a <- a/norm(a, type = \"E\")\n         d <- abs(sum(abs(o.a) - abs(a))) #delta between old and new authority scores\n         k <- k + 1\n         }\n   return(list(h = as.vector(h), a = as.vector(a), k = k))\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that the only modification is the addition of the multiplication by the inverse of the outdegrees in line 8, which divides the standard HITS hub score by the outdegree of each hub. \n\nThe resulting hubs and authorities scores are:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   hits.res2 <- status3(A)\n   round(hits.res2$a/max(hits.res2$a), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.693 1.000 0.221 0.414 0.223 0.538 0.759 0.494 0.187 0.470 0.552 0.361\n[13] 0.174 0.498 0.180 0.395 0.451 0.817 0.174 0.375 0.893\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(hits.res2$h/max(hits.res2$h), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.749 0.818 0.635 0.657 0.619 1.000 0.716 0.762 0.683 0.493 0.916 0.925\n[13] 0.639 0.972 0.543 0.835 0.842 0.508 0.590 0.642 0.604\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is an implementation of the \"HubAvg\" algorithm described by @borodin_etal05 [p. 238-239].\n\n### Exclusive Authorities\n\nIn the same way, depending on the application, it might make more sense to assign a larger hub score to hubs that point to *exclusive authorities* (authorities that are sought after by a few select others) and discount the \"hubness\" of hubs that point to *popular authorities* (those who are sought after by everyone). \n\nWe can implement this approach---let's call it the \"AuthAvg\" algorithm---with a slight modification of the `status2` function similar to the one we used to create `status3`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   status4 <- function(w) {\n     a <- rep(1, nrow(w))  #initializing authority scores\n     d.i <- colSums(w) #indegree of each node\n     d <- 1 #initializing delta\n     k <- 0 #initializing counter\n     while (d >= 1e-10) {\n         o.a <- a #old authority scores\n         h <- w %*% o.a #new hub scores a function of previous authority scores of their out-neighbors\n         h <- h/norm(h, type = \"E\")\n         a <- (t(w) %*% h) * 1/d.i #new authority scores a function of current hub scores of their in-neighbors\n         a <- a/norm(a, type = \"E\")\n         d <- abs(sum(abs(o.a) - abs(a))) #delta between old and new authority scores\n         k <- k + 1\n         }\n   return(list(h = as.vector(h), a = as.vector(a), k = k))\n   }\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd the resulting hubs and authorities scores are:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   hits.res3 <- status4(A)\n   round(hits.res3$a/max(hits.res3$a), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.651 0.579 0.877 0.694 0.819 0.658 0.548 0.784 0.855 0.733 0.761 0.736\n[13] 1.000 0.738 0.808 0.797 0.768 0.600 1.000 0.847 0.524\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n   round(hits.res3$h/max(hits.res3$h), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 0.266 0.116 0.700 0.564 0.734 0.035 0.358 0.341 0.593 0.734 0.119 0.072\n[13] 0.283 0.150 1.000 0.171 0.200 0.869 0.532 0.561 0.523\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<!--\n## A Final Ranking of Prestige Scores\n\nLike before, we can treat the the Regular Hub, and Authority Scores, their SALSA versions, and their hub and authority averaged versions as \"centralities\" defined over nodes in the graph.
